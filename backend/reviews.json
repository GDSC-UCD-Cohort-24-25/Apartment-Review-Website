I paid a $1200 deposit and they kept $500 for bogus charges like painting the unit, which of course wasn’t mentioned on my move out inspection.\n\nExpect to deal with multiple property managers and maintenance techs. I lived there a year, and interacted with at least 4 property reps and as many maintenance techs. The staff member who handled my refund, Rebeca, promised to follow up on my concerns, then stopped responding to my emails.\n\nThe only saving grace for this place is central heat/air, dishwasher, and washer/dryer in unit. But honestly, none of that was worth the hassle and headache of losing so much money. There are other complexes in Davis with better prices and customer service.",

Tarri helped with our move out/lease buy out process so that we were able to get everything done in about 2 weeks.

        "text_review": "I lived in this apartment complex for 2 years before new management took over in 2017. After the transition, the new management put financial and psychological pressure on the previous residents and forced many of them out of their apartments in order to make surface-level changes to the complex and hike the rent up by $500 a month. I do not begrudge them the right to remain competitive in the Davis rental market.\n\nWhat I do condemn is the way in which they continuously showed blatant disregard for the residents they were forcing to leave. They had a work crew in and out of my apartment for the entire month of July. The entire fiasco ended up costing me the equivalent of $250 in lost apartment access and electricity costs (the crew needed to have the apartment door open and plug in power tools). I couldn't use my shower for two days. They compensated me $50.\n\nThough the new management replaced the cabinets, floors, appliances (in some units), built little fences, added a fitness room, and painted the outside of the apartments green, they made these changes at the expense of other more pressing concerns. I know from a member of the crew working in my apartment, that a few of the units have rodent problems.\n\nI urge you, if you have another choice for housing in Davis, please do not move in to Cottages on Fifth. The management has no incentive to care about the well being of their residents, and they will try to take as much of your money as they can. These apartments may look attractive, but they are not worth the price that the management is asking.\n\nI now live in a complex I enjoy much more. The management is responsive, kind, and welcoming. The apartments are well built and well kept. I pay roughly the same amount. It is possible to find a better home in Davis. Please do not give Cottages on Fifth your money.",

Apparently his approx 1300 selected employees stay because they're ok with enforcing his under the table rules.  RULES?  --- You're not going to get things fixed promptly. If your appliance breaks, expect them to bring in a limping one from another of their units.  If the manager at Cesar Chavez doesn't like you, she'll find reasons to write you up--and if you're on Sec 8 housing permit...this threatens your eligibility, i.e. your housing security. YET, there are tenants freely selling drugs, fighting/screaming, etc --police come periodically.\n\nRats are also tenants at Cesar Chavez. -----       Rats slide under the hot water heater closet door ( on her 2nd floor deck)then they lounge there in the sun, nibbling off the potted plants, waiting for the door into living room to open. Under Calif law, owner/manager is responsible for addressing unsanitary conditions: rat infestation, for example. This isn't happening, no matter how many complaints. Why doesn't daughter put a trap where hot water heater is? It's kept locked by manager.\n\nCommunity spirit? The 'lockdown' wiped out Monday night gatherings of fellow renters, for a sit-down meal (supplied by local organizations). Thankfully, a new social worker has been hired and she (Lori/Laurie) is BEST thing going at Cesar Chavez apts...yet she's overworked.\nIf my disabled daughter had another option she would've moved months ago.",

My favorite part about this apartment is the storage space! There is a TON of storage space for a one-bedroom, which is really nice. The con to the apartment, and I think this may go for all the apartments, is the lack of natural light.\n\nManagement here is really friendly and is responsive to emails, and maintenance responds very quickly and does a great job. The complex is quiet and neighbors have been polite. One pro is that there is direct access to the Greenbelt, and there is a Unitrans bus stop right outside with a bus that comes every 15 minutes on weekdays (pre-COVID). It is expensive, but not more so than other apartments in Davis. Overall, I recommend!",

When I first considered moving here, I saw the bad reviews and thought “maybe it’s because it’s mostly angry people that write reviews, positive experiences are usually not vocalized”. I was very wrong. The location of this complex is in a dangerous area of Davis. My car was broken into over winter break. The apartment itself is stuffy and run down but literally painted over to make it look new, definitely just a way to put lipstick on a pig. Management was unresponsive and hostile. An example of this is, consistently changed the locks to “community resources” like the gym as a way to punish all residents for “taking equipment”. At the end of our stay we left the apartment spotless, no damage to the walls, floors, or amenities. They kept our security deposit and charged us an additional $200. When asked what the charges were they provided an itemized receipt of “work that was done on repairs”. They said this work was standard procedure for every resident that moves out. By that logic, do not expect to get your security deposit back. They will take it from you. As it customary, they will respond under this negative review, please do not be fooled by their performative professionalism. It is likely they will not change.

I think some of the fellow neighbours would agree too.\n\nA few examples, managers are uncontactable, missing from the office or no answer email; constant miscommunication, they don’t read but rather reply the keywords by their guidelines, not even answering my questions and concerns; nonsense schedule on maintenance, they replace the locks of facility without informing us and we are responsible to make the effort for replacing a new set of keys. It happened 2-3 times during my whole stay in 2 years. Is my unit out of their service area or what? How can you “forget” every single time?; old equipment, I have never successfully used the printer once; ridiculous parking policy, Davis is known as a college town and students tend to leave town for holiday. However they often require a vehicle moving during the holiday. Have you ever considered about your customers? Apparently not.\n\nI can go on and on, their management is bad. Don’t get me wrong, the worker/handy man are helpful and friendly. I just couldn’t bear with the way they manage.\n\nUtilities are also expensive here, I paid almost the same price when I’m away for holiday the entire month. They have the breakdown and said it’s common share or something. I find that ridiculous.\n\nIf you think you can bear with a bad management, be my guest. It’s a nice quiet neighbourhood.",

However, on move in day it was clear the apartment hadn’t been cleaned, or prepped as promised. The AC was broken, and bathroom drawers were dirty. The apartment was also not the one I had been promised, and tiny. Of course this was back in 2020 so I did try to understand the lack of communication. I was in shock at how dark and small the one bedroom was, for the price they charged. I’m sure it’s even more now.\n\nThroughout my three years at Ellington there was problem after problem. The bathroom has black mold, and they had to tear out the entire bathroom counter. But all they did was kind of clean it, then reattach the old piece which still had black mold on it. I truly believe many of my health issues that arose, was due to black mold that the magnet didn’t seem to care about fixing. Then our washer, dryer started leaking like crazy. They did replace that. But the washer/dryer system is crappy (once again for the price they are charging here).\n\nWe were good tenants, and paid rent on time every single month. When my partner and I finished college he got a job a few months earlier than planned. We tried to break the lease but they still charged us for the entirety of the lease agreement’s rent. Fine, but then to make matters worse they came up with a bunch of false charges when we moved out. I had already moved out of state, and traveled all the way back just to take care of the final walkthrough and checkout. Gabby, the man anger was beyond rude and condescending. She also is the one that came up with all of these bogus charges, we ended up owing money instead of getting our deposit back.\n\nWe left the place clean, and in good condition. The only charge I was expecting was for some carpet that had been damaged. Anyways, I felt scammed with the random charges that didn’t make sense at the end. I also felt like they ignored the black mold problem, and constant car break ins when I lived there. I got my catalytic converter stolen right in front of my apartment and had multiple other break ins after that. The management really did nothing even when I told them that the parking spaces were super dark and there needed to be more light or cameras. Oh, and parking is a joke. You get one spot assigned to you (that is paid for) but otherwise there was never any parking, and they’ll tow your car if it’s parked anywhere it’s not supposed to be for even 30 seconds.\n\nAwful experience, and it’s like they slapped new paint and crappy vinyl wood flooring over moldy, old structures. Definitely wouldn’t reccomend this place to anybody, especially with how I was treated after being a good tenant for three years! What a joke.",

I want to end the lease with the apartment and pay a buyout fee. But the manager has been refusing to help me with the issue, and insisting that I have to pay all the rent until the end of August. That is 8 months of rent and a lot of money for me. I don’t understand how this apartment could be so greedy to make every bit of money from the tenants. They gave a ridiculous reason that buyout fee has to be paid in some specific form (money order) and not available from abroad. First of all, the contract never specified this requirement, and now they are making up terms and conditions by themselves. Secondly, they claim that I can pay all the 8 months of rent from abroad, but not the buyout fee. How is that logically possible? Thirdly, it is the management’s responsibility to assist with the tenant for the moving out process, and they don’t seem to understand that their job is to actually help tenants when issues arise, instead of sitting in the office and collecting money. It has been extremely difficult and frustrating to communicate with them, the manager seems reluctant to do their job to help me pay the buyout fee and move out. Please stay away from this management.",

        "text_review": "Living here was an absolute nightmare. We lasted only two months before we realized we had to get out for the sake of our mental well-being. The noise was relentless, with our upstairs neighbors hosting gatherings of 15 people or more, making it impossible to have any peace. To make things worse, sounds from other units traveled through the thin walls, so we could hear people having adult intimacy at all hours of the day, adding to the uncomfortable living environment.\n\nThe bathroom vents are all interconnected, meaning that if someone decided to hotbox their apartment, the smell would seep through the vents into our space, making it impossible to avoid. The entire building felt filthy, with dead cockroaches and even animal waste in the hallways—a clear sign of poor maintenance and disregard for basic cleanliness.\n\nOur unit felt grimy and outdated, with an especially unpleasant bathroom. The tub appeared to have been sloppily painted over multiple times, and the cramped layout made it feel even more claustrophobic and dirty. On top of everything, we were told by management that trains wouldn’t be an issue at night, which was a flat-out lie. The trains stop and brake right outside the building around 11 PM, so sleep was often interrupted by the loud, jarring noise.\n\nIn short, this was a terrible experience from start to finish, and I’m incredibly relieved we were able to move to a place that actually feels livable.",

Left me without bathroom electricity for over a year stating that the only way to fix it was to vacate me out until they could complete the repairs. I couldn’t afford to be relocated so it was never fixed. Almost two years go by and I ask to finally be vacated to allow me to move out of my horrible lease early. They refused and said the repairs could be done in a few hours. Finally I come to move out and they cancel my apartment portal preventing me from paying my final month of rent. The day they sent me my invoice they sent the amount to collections. I’ve never missed a payment and have fantastic credit so had I not seen through their scam there could have been major repercussions. They state the reason they sent it to collections was because my final statement was sitting in the mailbox I returned my keys to. Who sends important information to a mailbox that someone just turned over the keys for?! Overall the new staff is absolutely pathetic and this company needs to be investigated and be held accountable for how they are treating people. Everyone I made friends with in the apartments has since left and they are desperate for new tenants but beware and stay away at all costs!!",

I would say, for the $1100 or so rent, the place is everything I'd expect and need. The atmosphere is nice, the noise isn't too bad, and the provided furniture + appliances are a great deal. I would also like to add that they have frequent events to boost the community experience. The main issue is that, for $1300, I could be living alone with a better layout, benefits, and exclusion of three other people living with me. I doubt a google review will change management's mind, but that price is outrageous.",

Although Davis is a college town, there's a great mix in demographic here, with some students, but with a lot of families, retirees, etc., as well. The property manager is very approachable and takes a genuine interest in her residents.

I was shown a completely renovated apartment and given one with extremely old appliances, wood and counter damage, and peeling baseboards perfect for the roaches to hide under! From what I've seen around the area, any other complex is better maintained! I ended up here because I was moving from out of town for a school and was convinced the apartments would be the condition of what I was shown.

        "text_review": "They are crooks that prey on college students.   Yes, your stay there will be nice, but beware of when you move out.  They will try to charge you for things that aren’t needed and they will refuse to show you proof of damages.   It’s so bad and disrespectful to treat college students like this.  They are young and learning the ways of the world.  So if you want to teach your kids what NOT to do and how to treat people poorly, then let them stay here.   Crooks all around.\nIf you do choose to stay here, take photos of EVERYTHING before you move in.  Walls, ceilings, floors, cabinets, kitchen, everything you can think of.  Demand a walkthrough with them before you move in.   When you move out, demand a walkthrough with them again and make sure you bring your photos or they will deny everything.  The lease is a joke.  They say “reasonable wear and tear” but it’s so arbitrary that they will force you to pay to repaint the whole apartment, even if you don’t leave any holes or marks on the wall.   It’s not our responsibility to pay for the routine maintenance for the next tenant.  That’s part of the property owner’s cost of doing business.\nJust BEWARE of hidden fees and BS charges when you move out.  They are crooks!",

        "text_review": "We lived at Alvarado Parkside for almost 4 years. We loved the location--close to the Davis green belt and grocery stores and just a few minutes drive from downtown and the UCD campus. The onsite managers, Izzy and then Jessica, were great. Good communication, very responsive, respectful, and pleasant to work with. Maintenance team was also very responsive every time we needed something addressed.\n\nUltimately, we decided to move out due to the following factors that you may want to consider before moving here:\n\n- The buildings are dated, not insulated, and the windows have not been updated. As a result, there was very little insulation and drastic temperature swings between summer and winter. The AC and heating had trouble keeping the place comfortable, and our electricity bill in summer and winter would average almost $250/month, even while we were trying to conserve our use AC/heat use. In summer, we slept with ice packs on our bodies to stay cool and try to sleep.  The landlord doesn’t allow space heaters. We heard from multiple other tenants that their electricity bill exceeded $400/month at times. This was the primary reason we decided to move out into a newer and more modern place, which, after all costs accounted for, is costing us less per month to rent.\n\n-The landlord’s (Tom) communication skills could be improved. Requests to the community through emails came off as threats rather than respectful requests. We’ve also come across Tom yelling at his maintenance personnel and property manager on multiple occasions. I recommend reading some more recent reviews on Yelp.\n\n-Make sure to do a walk-through inspection before you move out if you want any part of your security deposit back. Heard from others that they got $5 of their deposit back after they deep cleaned their unit and followed all check-out procedures before moving out, so we made sure to schedule a walk-through and came to an agreement of how much of our security deposit we would get back.\n\n-The free wifi through Instaconnect was pretty spotty. We got our own wifi.\n\n-Hot water was spotty. Water for showering was lukewarm from around 11am – 5 pm each day.\n\n-The bathrooms had little ventilation (no window, vent fan was weak), so the ceiling was prone to mold and mildew. We got a dehumidifier to help keep the bathroom dry.\n\n-We could hear traffic and sirens on Covell every day. Wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a quiet place.\n\nOverall, we would not recommend Alvarado Parkside.",

Star Crossed Properties and Tom were straightforward to work out a lease contract with. The process felt transparent and honest compared to other management companies I've considered in Davis. Management overall feels more respectful than other places I've rented from in Davis.\n\nNoticed this property has been well cared for compared to nearby options with similarly aged buildings. Quick to respond to maintenance requests. Laundry room is clean and affordable compared to other properties in Davis.\n\nExtra amenities such as the garden plots, communal park areas, and pool are lovely to have and well maintained.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice is high, but that really applies to all of Davis. I cannot deny the quality of management here, and that it's cost is in line with other options in Davis but provides a better experience than other options.\n\nThe onsite Wi-Fi provided by \"Instaconnect\" has been spotty and unresponsive to customer service requests, but this is not Star Crossed Properties fault. The responsibility falls mostly on Instaconnect to maintain their infrastructure better.\n\nSummary:\n\nI love Alvarado Parkside Apartments, so far it's been a great experience overall! I may update this review in the future as my Tenancy continues here. Looking forward to the rest of the year!",

Them plus the floor plan were the reason we stayed so long here. And at this point I would like many other reviewers here and give a 5-star as well.\n\nHowever, we were really disappointed at the move-out experience!!! Be ready that at move-out they would be very picky at every corner and hidden places that you would not even think of, so be sure to check every possible place before move-out or you might lost greater part of your deposits. Also they offered us a early moveout option which we thought kind of nice at first place, but it turns out that I’m paying the same rent with an apartment that I cannot use in any way because no one would take a summer lease. Just make sure that they have someone to take the room before signing the form.",

        "text_review": "Sterling 5th Street is an amazing apartment complex to live in, the best in Davis! I couldn't recommend it enough! Let’s start with the pricing, which is modest and affordable, especially considering the incredible facilities. For the 2024 year, I managed to get my own private bedroom and bathroom in a 5x5 apartment for $1,099 per month. I’ll talk more on how Sterling compares to other housing options in Davis at the end of this review, but first, let me talk about the details of the apartment.\n\nApartment Features:\nThe 5x5 unit (their most affordable option) is incredibly spacious, much larger than any other apartments I toured in Davis. Each bedroom comes fully furnished (at no additional charge) with its own private bathroom, bed, desk, chair, and plenty of storage. My unit even has a spacious walk-in closet! There are 2 large windows that allow you to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nThe private bathroom is massive, modern and with all-new fixtures. The common areas are equally as modern. The living room is large and comes furnished with comfortable couches, a coffee table, and a big TV. The kitchen has a huge island with 5 bar chairs for entertaining, plenty of cabinet space for all five residents, and new appliances. The in-unit washer and dryer are also large and new.\n\nWhile you can hear noise within the unit (e.g., someone cooking or talking in the living room), it’s better soundproofed than any other student apartment I’ve visited in Davis. The walls between apartments are thick, so I never hear my next door neighbors. Traffic and train noise are nonexistent, even though I live on the south side around 300ft from the tracks.\n\nAmenities:\nSterling’s amenities are the best! There’s a pool and a heated jacuzzi, study areas on every floor, and a large main study area with private rooms and free printing (30 pages/month). The game room features a pool table, and the community kitchen is perfect for hosting events. Wifi is fast everywhere.\n\nThe gym is my favorite amenity. It’s huge, well-equipped, with most equipment you can find at the ARC. With dumbbells up to 75 lbs, mirrors throughout, and great views of the pool, it’s convenient and saves me time and money from driving and parking at the ARC.\n\nThere are also BBQs scattered around the property, making it great to host gatherings. The secured parking garage is spacious, with plenty of spots even for general parking pass holders like myself. There is also a bike garage.\n\nStaff and Management:\nThe staff at Sterling are fantastic! Shoutout to Angelina and Jonathan, who have been incredibly helpful and friendly every time I need assistance. The leasing office is open daily, and maintenance requests are addressed quickly (usually within 1-3 days). The team is polite, accessible, and always willing to help.\n\nLocation:\nWhile Sterling is a bit far from campus compared to pther apartments in Davis, it’s manageable with a car. For bikers, the nearby bike highway to the West on the overpass works well!\n\nPricing Comparison:\nSterling stands out as the best value for student housing in Davis, especially with how new and great their amenities are! Other apartments for the 2025-2026 year charge upwards charge of $1,400-$1,700 for private rooms without private bathrooms, or $1,059 for shared bedrooms in overcrowded units like Identity, which accommodates up to 12 people. By comparison, Sterling’s pricing and modern buildings are unbeatable.\n\nI moved in mid-Fall quarter of 2024, and initially hesitated to renew my lease due to being new. But after a month, and after touring other apartments for the 2025-2026 year, I realized how much better Sterling was. Unfortunately, I missed the opportunity to lock in the $1,099 rate for the 2025-2026 year but was offered a reasonable $1,229, which is still far better than any other private bed+bath in Davis for 2025-2026.\n\nLearn from my mistake, sign up for Sterling asap (spots always run out!) and renew your lease early! This place truly offers the best student housing experience in Davis, with affordability, luxury, and convenience!",

They do not stay on track with issues on leases and the communications between themselves are lacking.\n\nI lived here for two years and went through a couple times when there’s a change in who lives in the household. They took almost a year to remove the people who no longer lived in the house and we ended up having five names when only three of us actually lived there. They charge utilities by the number of people in each house and we were just paying extra month by month. We had to sign new leases over and over again because their staff take forever to respond and doesn’t remember why we sign the new lease in the first place.\n\nI also heard lots of bad comments on them charging unreasonable amount of deposits after people moved out.

Then, two months later, the Office informed us that the price would be raised to $4800, because we confirmed at that time that the apartment type would not be renovated. Units that do not undergo renovation are all renewed and will not be offered to new resident. And when they first signed the contract, they advertised that our housing type would be renovated. So they actually just think that the price increase is not enough and find an excuse to cheat us. The employee was very good when the contract was signed at the beginning, but the manager who informed us later had a very bad attitude. Don't believe what their officer says, because they often lie",

        "text_review": "Throughout my 3 years of living here, I have never experienced more issues than after Sorrento switched their management in July 2022. I would *strongly* advise against living here for multiple reasons, most of which stem from the incompetent management and lack of concern for tenants.\n\nThe management is not transparent with any of the changes made to our lease. Our utility bills were paused for over 6 months with no communication up until yesterday, when an expensive bill was tacked onto our regular rent the day before it was due. We have also experienced multiple issues where Sorrento charged us the incorrect amount without approval or prior communication, resulting in a credit card discrepancy on my personal account. Management claimed they were unable to refund us the wrongly taken money. Instead, the incorrect charge is returned to us through credit for the next month's rent. This should not be taken lightly as many college students struggle to pay rent and cannot afford the impact of this mistake.\n\nThe leasing office is extremely understaffed, which is confusing because it seems like Sorrento puts funds towards almost every department (construction, repainting, advertising) EXCEPT for the customer service/management staff that they desperately need. Often times, it takes 5+ phone calls to speak to someone about a small issue, let alone something urgent like a power outage. If you try to get in-person assistance, the front desk lady is never on time, sometimes several hours late to open up the leasing office. Management shows little sympathy and true concern for the needs of their tenants.\n\nRegarding their facilities, everything is just \"okay\". Laundry room often has broken machines, our kitchen fridge and dishwasher were partially broken when we moved in, and nothing was cleaned as promised. Definitely not worth any of the hassle that we have endured.\n\nOverall, we have had a disappointing experience to close out our last year living at Sorrento. To future students and residents, we advise you to look elsewhere for housing.",

From broken elevators to lack of transparency with pricing, the list of issues is endless. Their customer service is abysmal. Instead of resolving problems, they resort to making threats. They even lost one of my packages and refused to take responsibility, despite sending me multiple emails confirming they had it. I deeply regret signing a lease here. The poor management, lack of accountability, and overall disregard for residents make this a terrible place to live. I would not recommend Identity Davis to anyone.

Pietro was supposed to take care of one dog but ended up living with three and Maria sleeping in the common area of the house (when she wasn’t supposed to live there). He left in July instead of October 2024 and to this day we still didn’t get the money back. Maria keeps making up excuses.\nWe talked to Vicky and the people at the reception about the situation and they didn’t help in any way. They are well aware of what Maria does, and still allow it. CRAZY. Our only choice is a lawyer. Luckily we still have all the emails and conversations as proof. She already gave the money back to other people that were living with Pietro but keeps making up excuses to him. If Vicky or the people working here can do anything about this, we’ll be very happy, otherwise we’ll proceed with legal actions. We waited too much already.",

They do offer reserved parking for a reasonable fee ,on the otherhand i'v lived at a apt just down the street that was quick to have a vehicle towed if parked in wrong spot or forgeting to put parking pass in window and as a resident this resulted in my car being towed twice and one of my visitors towed ,\"no thank you\"  Over all it is a great place to live and seems s like Jessica is dedicated to making improvements and upgrades to Davinci A great place to call home\nThanks Davinci\nTom and Beverly Schrader fifteen year residents of Davis.\nOwners of Davis Dryer Vent Cleaning & Davis Mobile Mechanics",

I moved in and things were not updated as they were supposed to be.. another huge issue with this place is it has BAD roaches. My family and I were constantly sick living here, I don't know for sure but I am assuming it was from the roaches. Which I read can cause ppl to be sick.. when I moved in Alan was the manager, he was ok. Never had any issues with him besides his slow response to emails and service requests. However, all of a sudden he disappeared. No information to the tenants as to what happened. After that we did not have any consistent manager. Madison took over part time. She was fine, never had any issues with her, she answered my emails in a timely manner. I would not recommend this property due to the roaches, the price/quality of Townhome, and the management issue. I feel that you can get your money worth else where in Davis.

Multiple times now myself and prospective cosigners have reached out asking for important documents such as the welcome letter, or lease agreement. Each time, we were told that he'd get back to us within a week or two, and each time was a lie. After an utter failure on the behalf of the property manager, I reached out to the regional manager. My first couple of attempts made to reach out to the RM were as futile as the PM. After a bit of a gap and another attempt, the welcome letter was given to us. By this point, we'd paid 250 dollars total, and whatever the legal maximum cost for a background check in California is. Following the first necessary document signing,  myself and a cosigner met with the man so we could discuss move-in and the lease proper. We were promised our full lease within a week or so of emailing him when we'd be available to move-in. On my part, I took about a week to tell him when we'd be available to move-in. The next day I was told we'd be sent the lease agreement by the end of the working week at the latest. A couple days after, it was next week. 12 or so days later, I email him asking for an update on that lease agreement. Nothing. Its been over a month now since I was promise the lease agreement. Nothing.\n\nThe management here is an utter mess if none of the other comments here have made it clear already. Not only the property management, but the regional management as well, if only for allowing this menagerie of chaos and cruelty to occur. The manager here and the those above him are making people's accessibility to housing difficult for no good reason I'm sure, and harming plenty in the process. Do not even apply for this place--or any other FPI Management property for that manner--you might as well throw 250 and more out the window and wish it a good day.

        "text_review": "These apartments are located very conveniently to the college campus.  Access to other important things like grocery stores are also available nearby.  The rent is on the lower side of most apartments around, but so is the general maintenance of the facility.  You can easily say it's a \"little\" run down and from what I've witnessed, it doesn't get much attention from the management/ownership either.  There are no elevators, so if you are moving into the top third story apartments, you'll get plenty of exercise.  Parking is cramped and it has a low ceiling as part of the open garage, so if you drive a truck or a full sized car, good luck with that.  Overall it appears to be safe, but by looking at it, you might question if that's truly the case.  Bikes have been known to be stolen from here, so pay attention.",

Brenda was a terrible manager who would not help us fix broken utilities and only cleaned up the pool when her family came over. Otherwise the pool would look green and be full of sticks and even got a health code violation. The study room? Filled with mattresses the whole year I was there. Laundry room? Broken. I cleaned up everything before I left and never got my security deposit back. If you have a choice to lease elsewhere, do it.",

This is coming from someone who was looking for any place to stay that was under $400 a month, which is why I'm mainly happy with my apartment. It depends on your opinion, however, if you're looking for a decent place that's near college city life, this is a good place to live. Additionally, it is true that this complex is old and some things can be broken or \"run down\", BUT if you tell the manager, it will be fixed. No problems with me on that. And depending on who you live with, and how accustomed you are to apartment life in general, this place is clean. And older building, yes, but good for living, honest opinion.",

        "text_review": "Parents and students… BE WARNED!  Stay away from UNIVERSITY COURT; 515 Sycamore LN in Davis CA.   The entire complex is infested with rats and unethical management practices.  The only good thing about University Court is the location (located next to Trader Joes and across the street from UC Davis).  We moved my son into his apartment at University Court  (UC) in SEP 2021 and were provided a lease agreement that guarantees liability/responsibility for the unpaid debts of the other lease holder/roommate who fails to pay their half of the rent on time.  It’s my fault for not reading the fine print… so please don’t make the same mistake I did.  During the period of 09/15/2021 through 08/30/2024, my son had three different roommates, who either left after transferring into another school, or dropped out due to poor grades. Each time we received aggressive and intimidating letters, emails and phone calls from University Court management telling us that we were responsible for the other roommate’s rent/liabilities regardless of our good standing for paying our half of the rent on time.  When we tried to discuss or dispute the situation with UC management… the only thing they would say is, “it’s in the lease and if you don’t pay the total amount we will simply send your account to a collection agency, ruin your credit and evict your student from the apartment”.  To add insult to injury… the entire apartment/complex is infested with HUGE RATS (we have the photos and the videos to prove it!).  After repeated complaints to UC management… their response was to send a maintenance person to the apartment and set two rat traps (which did absolutely nothing at all).  The rat infestation got so bad that my son had to move out two months early and find another room to rent so he could graduate on time.  When his lease was finally up we returned to the vacant apartment… and were horrified to see how the rats had eaten the furniture, carpet, baseboards, and parts of the doors and walls.  The apartment was filled with rat droppings and the smell of rodent urine.  Instead of moving my son’s furniture and belongings out of the apartment, we were forced to throw everything away due to the damage and infestation issues. We were afraid of disease and the possibility of spreading the rat infestation into his new apartment.  The situation even gets worse! After thoroughly cleaning the apartment and turning in the keys… UC management refused to inspect the apartment with us in order to view the damage and rat infestation. They told us they were sorry for the rat issues and they would refund our $700 security deposit once they did their own inspection 3 days later.  Not only did this corrupt UC management staff keep our $700 security deposit… but they charged us an additional $149.19 for painting, cleaning and damage caused by the hungry rats.  And yes… it was followed up with an additional threatening letter telling us to pay the bill or face the consequences of a collection agency that would ruin our credit score.  We are reporting University Court to the authorities and to the UC David Health commission in order to protect other UC Davis students from University Court’s unscrupulous management practices.  Please stay away from University Court… there are other apartments available in the immediate area without rats (this includes the rodents and the employees who work for University Court).",

The management changed around end of last year and since then they have been fantastic! Art, the new manager, is very approachable and helpful and welcoming always. They were also very understanding about my ESA cat. The only cons were that the laundry room and garbage area was really far from my unit and especially since I was on the third floor but the elevator helps. Also my unit was above the gate so I would hear it slam a lot and since it’s a big complex you hear people come and go but it’s not too bad at all. Another thing was that the kitchen was too cramped for my liking with no dishwasher and the AC is only in the living room but buying a fan solved that for the most part for me. Overall really great experience! Great amenities, quick maintenance, clean,  well-maintained environment and just a really great community! The clubhouse has a billiards table and seating areas where I’d hang out with friends and the complex did resident events which were nice to go to. Would definitely recommend living here, I only moved out due to wanting a 1 bedroom instead of the 2 bedroom that I shared with a friend and theirs is out of my price range.",

The mail system with the lockers is very easy and convenient. Sunsets are pretty here.\n\nCons: sometimes roaches and bugs get into the lobby, Wi-Fi is not the best, but if you don’t game often, you won’t have many issues. Laundry is expensive.\n\nMy roommate and I had a water leak in our router and it got fixed around a week later, as they were short staffed. The maintenance guys were kind, though.\n\nIt’s around a 12 minute bike ride or a 45 minute walk from my building to my first class of the day- for that reason, I’m unsure if I’ll live here next year. I’d prefer somewhere closer to Campus. For transfer housing though, it’s not a bad option, so I’d give it 3.5 stars.\n\nUpdate: 1/17/23\n\nMore cons: The Green is susceptible to losing power (especially/specifically 184 Horizon. They’re on a different grid than all the other buildings for some reason.\n\nWi-Fi issues! As I’m writing this now I have no Wi-Fi and am unable to start my assignments.\n\nIf you want to park close to your building without tandem parking, and live in 298 Citron/Horizon good luck! There’s barely any unassigned parking near those buildings, and you’ll have to walk 0.2 miles just to get to your car. It’s over $600/year, by the way.\n\nIt’s not that close to campus compared to other apartment complexes.\n\nMy apartment had another water leak due to poor patching of the celling with little response from maintenance. They are very helpful when I could get ahold of them in the past, though, but I can’t say I enjoy scattering pots and pans around to catch the water.",

The assistant facilities director contacted me very quickly and apologize. He went out his way to make sure that the washers were clean and I was compensated. He made everything very smooth and easy. He was easy to talk to and made sure he was doing everything he could. I washed again this week and the washers were completely clean. He then assured me that he would be doing this process annually. He genuinely helped me and assured that the future this would be an issue!",

        "text_review": "I can’t say enough bad things about the green. First of all, the parking situation is RIDICULOUS. They leave empty space and dead fields next to the likely intentionally small lots and then charge upwards of $700 for parking, which is usually completely full anyways resulting in a nearly half mile walk to your apartment. Catalytic converter theft is rampant yet they do not care at all nor do they make any attempt to deter such thefts. They do not care about anything other than squeezing every penny from their tenants that they can. Tiny washing machines, terrible management, god awful communication, bad power, water, and internet among other things. My apartment has some outlets that aren’t even real, there is a layer of plastic behind them preventing them from being used. On top of that, there are switches in the bathroom that don’t even do anything? No fan in the bathroom either. The oven creates so much smoke and takes an eternity to preheat despite it being almost brand new. The cabinet space is awful especially under the sinks, where they put up a board in an attempt to make it look clean but instead just create a huge inconvenience for anyone trying to actually live there. The room selection process was also very bad, and information was given so late everyone was left scrambling. Plus only one Ethernet port for the entire apartment? Seriously? How can they be that out of touch to not realize that college students use Ethernet for more than just a TV? Paint on the walls is super cheap and will easily scrape right off if you bump it with your fingernail. My dorm has a nail that is FACING UPWARDS in the carpet! It’s poked me and my roommate many times before we realized what it was and covered it with some tape. I’ve heard there are also lots of thefts at the mail room although i have not experienced this, but it isn’t surprising at all. The only positive thing i have to say is the maintenance guys are super chill, and very responsive. Came to our apartment about an issue with the stove on the same day and were very helpful. Avoid the green at all costs, especially if you are planning on bringing a car.",

        "text_review": "Casitas was one of the few places in Davis that offered a short-term fall quarter lease, which I badly needed. Management was very responsive and courteous when I was signing up for a unit. The apartment also had plenty of nice amenities, like a pool and hot tub, laundry room (although they also rent out in-unit washers and dryers), and printing services. Personally I was glad to use the hot tub, since the one at my previous apartment was closed for a long time due to COVID. The actual unit itself was really nice, and maintenance was very quick to respond.\n\nOne minor complaint I do have is that I can hear people talking loudly at night outside sometimes, probably at the parking area. I guess that's outside the apartment's control. One of my roommates also noted that the freezer in our apartment wasn't cold enough to keep his ice cream frozen.\n\nI also got my full deposit back (both the base and the pet deposit), which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nBoth the apartments I lived in at Davis happened to be managed by Tandem Properties, and I highly recommend getting a lease with them.",

The units are kind of rundown, but it's nothing terrible. However, that being said, I wouldn't recommend living here less than one year, as they may take a lot out of your security deposit because the lease states that they can. We cleaned our unit well and trust me when I say there was no need for more paint on the walls, but we still got charged for cleaning and painting. So, in the end, a good place to live if you're looking for somewhere longer than a year.",

Temescle sent  the boys to collections as a scare tactic and forced them to pay over 600 dollars in damage which there was again,  was none.  This all happened in September/October. We are now in February and after many calls by the boys, nobody AGAIN will return a call and they have yet to receive the money owed to them. This place is a scam in every way possible.

Upon your exit from your apartment, they will come in and do their cleaning and painting and then tell you that there was damage and they know they can get away with it even though they were there less than a year. They send you to collections without telling the tennants what damages they are being charged for.

Our lights in the apartment also flicker a lot and can’t really be screwed back on because it’s a digital led light. Lastly but most importantly the last 2-3 months the water keept getting shut off with little or sometimes no notice and when it turned back on it would be muddy and or still without heat or low pressure. All in all I’d give the apartment a 2 star if it wasnt for the inconvenient water issues for months but I do have to say the staff was friendly and attentive.

        "text_review": "I lived at La Salle for two years, and I cannot recommend this apartment complex. There was turnover of management in my time there, and it genuinely felt like they cared little for the residents, and only about taking as much money from us as possible. While the location was nice, the apartment and amenities did not seem worth it for the price. During my time there, parking costs increased significantly (it went from one free spot allotted to a 1 bdr/1bth, to costing $300+ per year!). The parking lot was huge and never full, and their justifications for this increase simply did not make sense. They claimed it was so passes could be offered for shorter time periods to \"help\" residents, yet the new \"minimum\" parking pass period was 6 months, and the cost of the shorter parking pass time period quickly exceeded the cost of a full year pass. Basically, they made it not even worth it to get a shorter parking pass, all while significantly increasing the cost of parking overall. Parties and noise were quite consistent, so I would avoid this place if you're looking for somewhere quiet. I once locked myself out of my apartment (it was a freak accident, my sliding door lock fell back into place), and upon calling maintenance, I was told that it wasn't their problem because they wouldn't get paid to help, and to figure it out myself, forcing me to call a locksmith. While this was my fault, it certainly showed that they will not go above and beyond to help their residents. Management was inconsistent with their construction notifications--in fact, they once provided less than 45 minutes notice that cars needed to be moved for parking lot construction the following day, before they began towing cars! Before move out, we were provided a clear list of things to clean before move out, which my partner and I strictly followed (we even cleaned more than we were asked to). We were then told by the manager to not worry about cleaning during their inspection of our apartment because \"most residents don't clean what they need to anyways.\" They told us that the complex had to hire professional cleaners due to COVID, and made us foot the bill for their required protocols. When we told the manager that we were thoroughly cleaning the place as outlined on the move-out form, they told us to not bother, and they took out a significant chunk of our deposit anyway. While I initially enjoyed living at La Salle, I highly suggest to look elsewhere.",

Despite begging us to accomodate new customers by moving out earlier than our lease initially stated (an increasingly complex task amidst covid conditions) and promising us part of our last month's rent back, La salle ended up refusing to return out rent because their agreement with the next tenants fell thru. Additionally, despite advising us on what to clean and providing an \"itemized list,\" nearly our entire deposit was withheld. While neither of these things may be illegal (im not sure), it certainly isnt the kind of business I'd like to associate with again. My advice is to make peace with being scammed or find a new complex",

I've had no complaints with our units and maintenance is always quick to respond to requests (usually come the day of or the next day). The washer and dryers are relatively new and were usually working just fine. The community director, Lexi, is newer but has been such a great addition to the team and has been nothing short of amazing. She's always really responsive and once even helped us bring a package inside our apartment while we were on vacation, she made our moving out process really easy. I also want to say that the maintenance team especially, Sal, is really on top of it. I also love that the complex will host community gathers and events where they will provide food, drinks, snacks, etc. I hope they continue to do this throughout the year.

Ryder has an affordable housing program that includes all amenities AND you don’t have to pay for utilities (it’s covered). I’ve lived at two other apartment complex’s here in Davis and none of them compare to Ryder. Ryder has one of the biggest apartment gyms, multiple study rooms with free printing, a social lounge, karaoke room, fully furnished units, in unit washer & dryer, and it’s very close to campus. As a college student who has been living here the past 2 years I love it!",

The front office staff was very nice and helpful, and many of the residents were friends with them. The units are spacious and comfortable but the kitchen is really undersized for 3+ people.\n\nThe location is convenient for accessing the freeway, downtown, and campus. The Richards-Olive intersection gets terribly congested and it's annoying having to go through it every time you enter/exit Olive Drive. There's also a liquor store and In-N-Out nearby and the air often smells like fries.\n\nMy biggest complaints would be the noise and the strange people roaming Olive Drive. Having a liquor store next to an apartment full of undergrads means parties happen often (I should know, I partied here many times even before I was a resident). And since the pandemic, a bunch of homeless people started hanging around outside begging for money, passing out next to buildings, peeing on the sidewalk, or walking down the street at night screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nI lived in Davis for over a decade and Lexington was one of my favorite apartments as far as the units themselves and the staff. But unfortunately, factors beyond management's control prevent this place from being perfect.",

The apartments themselves are decent and you get what you pay for, but dealing with the leasing office has been a headache. They pretty much tune you out. Despite having quiet hours, noise has been an issue, and when I brought it up to the office, they brushed it off and suggested I reflect on my own actions instead – talk about unhelpful! Also, the number for reporting noise might as well be for show because it does nothing. And there's this new person at the front desk, blonde, who could seriously work on her attitude. It's been a frustrating  to say the least.",

Then we had an ant infestation and she would just shrug it off. There were ants in the carpet, floors, kitchen, literally everywhere. And on top of that, the floor caulking of the bathtub was very badly placed which brought mold (a lot of it). She got mad that I would keep having work orders because the apartment was very run down. She would yell and bully me to the point that I needed someone else in the room with me because I did not feel safe. DO NOT LIVE HERE!

Not to mention we just experienced an extremely hot summer with an AC unit that didn’t work.

Although it is further from campus, Eastlake comes with great amenities such as proximity to bus stops and a nearby shopping plaza.\n\nThe staff is very fair and compassionate people; they work with you and explain things. One person I held in high esteem was the groundskeeper John Shiner. He helped us with maintenance requests quickly and effectively. He once came late at night (11pm) to fix our water heater in the middle of the winter. He made my experience living at Eastlake better. The office (Nadia and Chris) are wonderful, friendly people.

The staff here goes WAY beyond just doing their job. Everyone I've interacted with here from the director, front desk, maintenance, all were extremely friendly and helpful, something that unfortunately is very hard to find in a lot of apartments.\n\nFor the price I am paying here, I would have had about half the space at West Village and I still would have had to pay extra for parking and bike a much farther distance everyday. Here, whenever there is an issue (which is almost never), I know its addressed very quickly. Even when there isn't an issue, maintenance always make the place better, even shampooing our carpets without request.\n\nEveryone who comes to our apartment is jealous of our place, you really can't find places like this at this value in Davis.

The bathrooms do not come with vents, so by the time our lease was over, the walls were covered in mold even tho the window was open all the time to help with the airflow.

That’s why I decided to write a review about my apartment complex and say thank you to Wildhorse Terracina  staff  specifically Rebecca(manager).I moved here 2 years ago and I love the staff. They listen to me and fix any problems I have as soon as possible. The first month after I moved here, my oven did not work. Two days after I called the office I had a new oven.  The maintenance needs are completed within the same day. It could be the AC or toilet. The guy is friendly, polite and professional. When I call or stop by the office I am always greeted by my name and very helpful with any of my needs. The property overall is always kept clean. I have lived in so many apartment around the US. I’ve never seen any office manager like Rebecca. She is really considerate and nice. I usually come home after office hours but if she is in her office she answers  my question and solves my problem. I say a big thanks to the team.",

        "text_review": "Management told us that we would be without hot water for over a week and has failed to compensate us. This is a housing code violation under California law.  It’s winter, so the water comes out ice-cold.  Many tenants are now forced to shower at friends’ houses, waste time to move hot water from the kitchen into the bathtub, stay at hotels, or risk their health by trying to clean their dishes with cold water.\n\nHere is what showering in Stonegate Apartments currently looks like: I had to go to Home Depot in Woodland to buy buckets and I have to boil water on the stove, which I then carefully move into the bathroom where I mix the hot and cold water.  I’m cleaning my dishes twice to try to lower the chances of getting sick.  All while paying nearly $1,900 a month (fees included) for a 1-bedroom that is not close to downtown.\n\nSpeaking of the rent, they told us that by re-signing the lease contract we will be paying less than the new tenants and it’s not true. Stonegate management is full of greedy power grabs and price gouging, so be warned.  I’ve lived at Stonegate for 3+ years and as a local guide I felt compelled to describe my recent experience facing this injustice.  We are still trying to live here without hot water.",

        "text_review": "After 3 years at Stonegate It’s disappointing to have to leave a review like others on here but I don’t want anyone else to be surprised by the management’s behavior.\n\nDespite returning the unit in a great condition (validated by multiple property managers from other apartment complexes) & (minus a little carpet spot that we anticipated a small distinguishable extra fee for), we received multiple $130+ deductions from our deposit. After jumping through hoops to receive the vendor invoices legally obligated to us, there were no separate fees distinguishable from basic cleaning rates that were vague, broad, and incorrectly labeled. Therefore they were completely unable to explain how they came up with the Random ~$130 charges relative to the invoices.\n\nThere were many other uncomfortable situations with the management throughout the duration of the lease as well:\n\nA few months in we complained about unmanageable mold overgrowth in the bathroom that appeared to be seeping out from behind the shower panels and fixtures, as well as inadequate ventilation, to which maintenance said “all units have mold in them, but we’re going to come take care of this because you guys take good care of your unit”.\n\nThe maintenance and management frequently gaslit us about issues, such as when our AC broke in the middle of a heat wave (115°F outside) and told us it was working fine and that we just needed to close our blinds during the day (which we always did) despite it being 95° in the apartment with the AC set to 58°. After 5-6 days of  insistent emails and office visits, they gave us a portable (which did not alter the apartment temperature at all, nor was it designed to cool a space of this size) and sent out a technician a few more days after that who immediately confirmed that the unit was busted and replaced it.  Not to mention a massive bee infestation on my patio that they did absolutely nothing about until there were thousands of dead bees piled up in the patio of the unit below me.\n\nFurthermore don’t bother asking maintenance for help, since their solution was to fix everything with a poor silicone caulking job. The kitchen floor was peeling up, they fixed it with caulking. Roaches were coming from under the dishwasher, they caulked a peice of plastic to the from of the dishwasher instead of plugging their entrance behind it. Mold was seeping into the tub, the caulked over it.\n\nBeware of a poorly lit parking lot ( which you also have to pay for if you need more than 1 parking permit), my car was egged, and my roommates car was broken into.\n\nAlso be warned about the hefty utility fees, which is ironic considering the utilities frequently have problems (see the recurrent hot water notices below).\n\nThe renewal rates are also incredibly steep and only reflect a few dollars off market rate—there is little incentive to stay.\n\nLastly, the apartment complex cycled through staff like water over the duration of my lease (though they may have slowed down for now), I’ve dealt with Anne-Marie, Jessica, Jazmin, Allie, Jahnai, Sabrina, Amy, and Ryan, but no one seems to be able to build good rapport with the tenants here (I’ve spoken to many).\n\nI wouldn’t put it passed them to respond to this review and try to defend themselves, they tried in our conversations but my concerns and arguments mostly went over their heads. The whole thing feels like a cash grab since they have so many empty units.",

There are plenty of bike paths to and from the campus and downtown. Overall, it's an OK place to live, but there are some things one should be aware of when considering moving here.\n\nMany aspects of this apartment complex can be improved, and left much desired. For one, my unit only had a AC unit in the dining room area. There is no central heating/AC. My unit also did not have a dishwasher. The complex is quiet for the most part, but can get loud if you live next to the pool area. The amenities are OK. The gym is tiny. The pool is cleaned every day, which is nice, but is also small.\n\nThe laundry rooms are part of what makes living here difficult. Almost always, at least one machine is down. Machines are often all taken on the weekends, so I would often elect to do laundry weekdays at night. The rooms usually had a dank, moldy smell.",

Not walking distance to downtown Davis but walking distance to a small strip mall with a market and some restaurants. Two stars for the very high security deposit and just general high cost for what you get.\n\nThe ‘refurbishing charges exceeding normal wear and tear’ were over half our security deposit.  We cleaned literally everything in the apartment and they charged us ~$180 for cleaning. There were nail holes in the walls when we moved in that I clearly made them aware of in our inspection sheet and they still charged us ~$90 for painting.  The carpets were new when we moved in and we vacuumed and cleaned them regularly and they still charged ~$100 for carpet cleaning.  How is cleaning the carpets not considered normal wear and tear?  We accidentally left a bag of dog food in our apartment when we moved out and they charged us $50 to remove it...\n\nNot a bad place overall but don’t expect to get much of a security deposit back.  Very obviously an investment group owned property which can be a plus and a minus.",

        "text_review": "I lived in Clubside apartments for a year between 2018 and 2019. The apartments are big and located in a quiet part of Davis, which is nice. However, it is really difficult to communicate with the manager or the maintenance. The manager is rarely in her office and the maintenance guy is usually just working on his bike by the pool.\nOver the year I lived there, my toilet broke (the day after my move-in), as well as my AC and oven. It would have been fine if they had fixed it in a timely manner, but it took over a month each time. The only thing that was fixed in a three day delay was my water heater, which broke in the winter. The maintenance had previously said in front of me that it was ready to explode and flood our place. Yet it took reminding them at least three times for someone to do something. Also, I lived on the second floor and the light did not work for over half a year. It was always dark and I'd have to use a flashlight every night not to fall down the stairs. Finally, the pool was closed for all summer for repairs which was really tough given the heat.\nOverall, I wish it had been easier to communicate with the manager and get my appliances fixed for the place to be truly habitable throughout the year.   If you are a person who  doesn't mind having to constantly remind them to fix the place or are yourself good at fixing things, I guess this complex would be fine. However, looking back on my time living there when some amenities didn't work makes me feel like this was the most stressful place I ever lived in. I would rather pay a little more for rent and live in a place that's habitable and gives you what's advertised in the price.",

Parking is available but it fills up because people let their friends park there (management never checks to see if people have permits) Manager herself is never really around, only time you will see her is when she's smoking by the pool or doing her laundry. The maintenance guy (her boyfriend) is always around fixing apartments people moved out of or cleaning the pool but mostly he's doing side projects and working on his truck (tool shed is attached to my apartment so I hear him in there until almost 1 AM every night). Right now the fan above my oven doesn't turn on, my AC blows out hot air, and there's a smell that comes from the bathroom sink. Every time I mention it I'm ignored. Laundry machines always leave my clothes dirty and damp (even on heavy duty setting), there's a \"lounge\" but its just a room with a pool table that only the manager has keys to. You would think that for $1,200 a month they would fix broken things in your apartment and you might get some amenities (I think the \"lounge\" should be turned into a small gym). Only good thing I have to say is that the rent is cheaper than most places in Davis and the residents are quiet.",

        "text_review": "I’ve waited to post my review of this place to see if my new apartment was the same or if renaissance was truly that horrible and it is. Living at Renaissance was one of the worst apartments I’ve ever lived in. When we toured I asked how much utilities would be on top of rent and was quoted no more than $50/month. We paid nearly $200 every month just for gas and electric and almost $350-$400 during the extreme heat because the insulation is so bad that no matter what you do you have to run A/C and heat constantly because the walls don’t keep anything in or out. On top of that, we paid about $100 per month for all other utilities (trash water,sewer, etc). So we ended up paying on average $300 per month for utilities after being quoted only $50. As others have mentioned, trees and branches falling seemed to be a big issue every time there was a storm. One instance a giant branch was blocking our entire doorway and luckily we were visiting family in another state but if we hadn’t been, we were asked if we could make other arrangements while they got the branch sorted saying it was going to be a few days. They hadn’t offered any type of compensation or accommodation up front for the inconvenience which is honestly not very good customer service. Speaking of, every time I needed to go into the office the manager was rude. Maybe not intentionally but if you give off rude vibes or RBF it ruins the whole experience in itself and creates just an unwelcoming environment. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.",

        "text_review": "Coming from a tenant of 4 years, as you’ll see with most reviews from this apartment complex, this is a terrible place to live. You’ll acknowledge this the first time you have any issue with your own apartment or and neighboring tenants. You’ll acknowledge how little they care by their subpar responses of “sorry for your dissatisfaction with our service…”\n\nI had multiple instances where they showed how little they cared for the people living here and/or making it a better place to live.\n\n1. A tenant with a very illegally modified car would park right outside my and others windows, start their vehicle at 4am every weekday morning and leave it running for 10-15 minutes. This vibrated the windows, I slept with earplugs, a sound machine, AND even boarded up the window to just try and drown out a little noise with complete fail. After putting a couple politely worded letters on the owners car of asking them to either park anywhere else in the lot to not wake up the residents and getting no response, I made a complaint to the leasing office that did nothing. I had such bad sleep deprivation that I had to go on anti depressants to help with my stress because this car would wake me up everymorning at 4am without fail. The leasing offices response was that he didn’t want his car getting broken into so he refuses to move where he parks. Fair enough, I get that you can’t enforce where they park in the lot, but they should be able to regulate the car if it’s affecting the health of other tenants. After months and months of pleading for help, the leasing office did nothing\n2. I witnessed a hit and run in a parking lot of theirs, put a note on the car that got hit informing them that I had the license plate of the car that hit them. After helping them, I was made aware that it was the partner of the owner whose car that was waking me up at 4am. Funny right? At this point I realized how little this couple cared for anyone else but themselves. A cop trying to get the insurance information for the owner who’s car was hit, went to the leasing office asking which unit they lived in, and was told that they wouldn’t give a police officer that information for an even an illegal activity that had occurred. The cop then came to my place asking for anything I knew about what was going on and told me that this was happening. So of course the leasing office was protecting this terrible couple for some reason which is highly unethical and unfair for any tenants whose lives were affected by them.\n3. After 2 years in an upstairs apartment with my partner (previously in another unit for 2 years), and with record high heat waves in the area, we realized our air conditioning unit was not working and leaving our apartment to reside at 85+ degrees even if we were cooling our apartment all day to try and be at around 72 degrees. This made our bills about $550-$650 per month, not joking. Myself and my wife made the leasing office aware of this since we first moved in, and they did nothing but send out a maintenance person that gave us the run around saying “it’s just like that”. This made the apartment inhospitable and I would occasionally stay at a friends place because they actually had a working AC unit.\n4. There are so many other instances like this that made living here incredibly difficult. I moved out because I got a job offer elsewhere and the only way out of the lease was to get another group to do a lease takeover. Knowing how bad this place was, I had a hard time trying to get anyone else to live here because I didn’t want to feel like I was tricking anyone.\nNeedless to say….. don’t live here, and I can guarantee that their response (if any) will show how little they care.",

The rooms are super spacious and every room has their own bathroom & mini fridge. There’s a beautiful pool area, nice & quiet study room, and a nice gym with dumbbells & everything. The management, leasing team, and maintenance team are also very helpful, responsive & kind! I love living here :)",

        "text_review": "We have lived in Davis for 10 years and Meadow Ridge was by far our favorite place to live. Since this apartment complex is about a 30-minute bus ride to campus, Meadow Ridge is more geared towards families and working professionals, which was ideal for us. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to the Nugget Marketplace and the best sushi restaurant in town, Huku Japanese Bistro. Meadow Ridge just updated their sports court, which meant playing tennis or pickleball was just a minute away.\n\nThe staff are wonderful and responds timely to any maintenance issues. Ion is very knowledgeable and works hard to fix everything onsite, from a leaky pipe to a broken washer. The office manager, Kristen, is always friendly and helpful when we had questions/concerns and made sure to keep an open line of communication.\n\nWe first lived in a 1x1 and then upgraded to a 2x1, and we always loved how spacious all the rooms were. It's also amazing that a good washer and dryer is included in unit - that's rare amongst Davis apartments!\n\nIf we didn't buy a house, we would have been happy to stay at Meadow Ridge. We recommend this apartment wholeheartedly.",

The maintenance staff, Ion, is very knowledgeable and professional. He knows how to fix everything from the drain to the appliances. When our dryer stopped working, he quickly found the root cause and made sure we had a working dryer ASAP.\n\nThe property manager, Kristen, is very approachable and helpful as well. Her clear communication keeps us informed about any upcoming changes, and she ensures any residents' concerns are heard and addressed.\n\nOverall, Meadow Ridge is dedicated to quality living and great service. Highly recommended!",

As an international student, I was all about exploring a new city, and Aggie Square quickly became the heart of my adventures. During my 2-year stay, every aspect of it was simply outstanding. Whether it was the super-responsive management or the maintenance team who fixed things at the speed of light, they were on it.\n\nWhat's really cool is that we hardly ever had any big issues to worry about. The apartment was all spruced up and well-maintained. The only maintenance request in our first year was a routine check by the management to make sure the blinds were in tip-top shape and the pipes were clear. They were all over it before we even knew it!\n\nAnd speaking of the management, they were like your friendly neighborhood superheroes. One of my best memories was the Thanksgiving bash with the Aggie community. We all got together for some great fun and even a lucky draw. Guess what? My roomies and I won Amazon gift cards worth $200, just for being awesome and renewing our lease without a rent hike. Sweet, right?\n\nAggie Square knows how to keep the surprises coming. At the start of the school year, we'd find donuts waiting for us, and during exams, it was fresh pizzas and more donuts. Plus, we could always count on top-notch Starbucks coffee to keep us going.\n\nLooking back, I can honestly say that I had a blast during my 2-year stay at Aggie Square. It was the perfect introduction to California living. Huge shoutout to Lauren and Francisco, the dynamic duo who always had our backs. They were super cool and ready to help with anything and everything.\n\nAggie Square, you totally rocked, and I'm super thankful for all the fantastic memories and experiences I gained during my time there. It was an epic way to kick off my California adventure! 🌟😊",

The only time they tried notifying us was through mail, which they will send it to your PREVIOUS address, not the permanent address. After that they will just toss the work to the debt collecting company with 1.09 star rating on BBB to match to their rating here. I can see why they work well together now.\n\nThis place will take your whole $900 security deposit and still asks for more. The whole time they will not show you any documentation of what or how the money was used, and if you do question about he price, you will get harassed by the debt company they hired. They don't care about customer service, especially about tenants that moved out already. It's beyond ridiculous how they still had the audacity to charge us this much after having constant issues at the property (Roach problems, sewage problems, trash disposal never working...etc ) .",

        "text_review": "The apartment units are decent and the maintenance team responds quickly for repairs. However, there's a pack of unsupervised kids with really bad behavior, that dominate the complex. They're loud, they swear and say crude things about sex and they congregate in the playground, so they smaller kids can't even enjoy it. Most of the good parents keep their kids inside and use neighborhood parks instead because the bad kids here make the playground and grassy areas unusable due to their behavior, fighting, and drama. In the summer, the pool gets closed for weeks at a time because of incidents related to these kids. Last summer, an apartment was egged and the police were called. The kids will also do things to deliberately provoke neighbors and then when the neighbor says something to them, they go get their low functioning family and friends and try to start a fight. The police are often called in these instances too. Last year someone was stabbed.\n\nAlso, a lot of drug recovery and domestic violence programs have been funneling people into the complex and it has really changed the atmosphere. These people are usually not quite ready to live independently and end up relapsing or inviting abusive exes to live here with them. They bring a lot of riff raff and drug activity around. There are constantly tweakers on bikes blasting music and dumpster diving. There have also been some drug sales in broad daylight.\n\nAlhambra has become the Davis version of the projects. There's also a lot of hoarders who bring mice and roaches and ruin it for the tenants that keep their places clean. I've  lived here for seven years and the past 2 years have gotten worse and worse.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\nPros:\n\n- Convenient location, close to Grocery Outlet, Dollar Tree, and Goodwill\n- Spacious bedrooms and individual allocated parking right outside the front door\n- Private backyard\n- Single-story blocks, reducing noise concerns from neighbors\n\nCons:\n\n- Neglectful maintenance; repairs often involved replacing old parts with used ones. They act like they’re doing everything to solve your issues but actually they don’t.\n- Persistent pest issues, including roaches, snails, and mice (which caused significant damage to our vehicles)\n- Theft from the garage, including stolen shoes and a baby stroller\n- Unfair charges upon moving out, including cleaning fees and damages that were present before we moved in\n\nWhile the location and allocated parking were significant advantages, the numerous issues we experienced made our stay at Lanai Garden Apartments frustrating. If you're considering living here, weigh these pros and cons carefully.",

The on-site manager Diana is fantastic and is always a great help regarding any concerns. And the maintenance man is also very prompt and always does a solid job fixing/replacing anything for us. Noise/sound is fairly manageable with the occasional bump or running footsteps coming from above but nothing that will affect one's sleep/focus.\n\nHighlights of the place:\n- Parking is pretty generous with its own dedicated parking lot as well as a good amount of street parking. Reserved parking is also an option but not really necessary in my opinion.\n\n- Location is as central to Davis as it's going to get. 10 minutes or less in any direction to get anywhere by car and has several bus lines running right outside the complex",

However, they forced me to pay more money than the deposit, due to pressures exerted by the debt collection company IQ Data in the name of Sharps and Flats. They made me pay for: Painting labor and materials (it's their responsibility according to California Tenants: A Guide to Residential Tenants’ and Landlords’ Rights and Responsibilities), apartment cleaning charges (California’s Department of Consumer Affairs: A landlord cannot routinely charge each tenant for cleaning carpets, drapes, walls, or windows in order to prepare the rental unit for the next tenancy), Drip pans, Traffic stains, Stretching DR LR hall plus clampdowns, Insurance (this was paid monthly), total damage charges, and utilities bills (this was paid before).\nThey didn't answer my emails and my requirements of proves about all this.

I'm currently back in the Bay Area and found a place cheaper than what this place is charging. Plus, needing to access the circuit breaker meant I had to go into my bottom floor housemates room in order to get to it.\n\nAlso, if any emergency comes up during your stay and you need to move out, good luck. Didn't matter if I was willing to pay extra to cancel. And yes, I went thru the process of trying to find someone to take over my lease. After telling them the price and learning that it was a shared space, I can't count the amount of times people ghosted or just said no to my face. Because of this, as I'm writing this review, I'm still having to deal with paying back people and recovering my emergency funds.\n\nIf you're sure you're staying here for a year, great. However, this place is not worth what they're charging and are fueling the problem with why housing is so expensive in Davis.",

Their management team is friendly, accommodating, and easy to reach; their maintenance team is skilled and quick to respond; and the location is great, with plenty of parking, easy access to downtown, and a laidback atmosphere.\n\nI highly recommend this place for anyone considering moving to Davis.",

        "text_review": "This place is not worth its close to 3k rent price. I wanted to love this place and was excited to move in. The pool is beautiful, the rec room is modern and nice, and the fitness center is great. The apartments themselves where you hope to be at home is where they fall extremely short. There is absolutely NO good AC whatsoever, the air vents don’t work at all in the bedrooms and there is one singular vent in the living room. The room temp never got below 89 and the apartment always felt like a sauna. We found ourselves eating out daily because of the peak hours being unbearable with no good AC and we couldn’t use the kitchen appliances or else it would be way too hot. There were cracks on the walls in many places. The paint job is so badly done that every single door sticks and when you open it, it makes such a loud noise. Everything sticks to the cabinet shelves because it’s so hot in the apartments. The wifi sucked and they decided to get rid of it and make residents pay for their own on top of increased rent pricing. All utilities had to be paid separately on top of rent. Every week the trash truck would come at 5am and wake the whole building up. The trash area was always destroyed and messy. There are bugs EVERYWHERE outside and they get into the apartments so easily. The doors and windows were always covered in layers of spiderwebs. All shutters on outside windows had fallen off. On top of all that, they REQUIRED we pay for an ENTIRE day at the end of our lease yet they required we be out by 7am. When asked why they got to decide when we leave yet we pay the whole day, they stayed silent knowing they were in the complete wrong. As if that wasn’t enough, their stairwells are unsafe and so wobbly it was unsafe to walk up most days. Overall this place is not worth the money, they put their money into their own office renovations and nothing into the apartments which look like they were built in the 1970s and never worked on. Would not recommend this place, you can find better for cheaper or the same price.",

We have encountered a significant issue with mold resulting from water leakage from the ceiling due to their negligence, which has resulted in damage to our belongings. Despite repeated notifications, management has failed to acknowledge or address the problem, leading to prolonged exposure to mold over the past few months. We will seek legal action to resolve this matter since they are ignoring our concerns.\n\nUpdate: after 6 months of exposure to mold with management doing absolutely nothing, we took them to court and management finally try to offer us 1 month of free rent for our trouble for over half a year.  Thankfully the court was reasonable and allow us to be compensated for the trouble :) never living here again and highly recommend everyone to live somewhere else",

When I moved in, all the carpet smelled like bong water.  Insane bug issue. Bugs EVERYWHERE and they surround the doors. In unit washer and dryer barely work. Above all, their wifi doesnt work. It just flat out doesnt work. They promised they were working on it and its been 7 months. Still doesnt work. Kitchen layout horrible designed. Rent is far too expensive for how bad this place is. Closed amenities (game/chill room) for no reason and got fined for going in. They focus their maintenance on unnecessary things like retiling the pool and it looking even worse after. No free parking.  Homeless people constantly around. Moving out ASAP when lease ends",

This is all in addition to your pge bill which will unfortunately be really high if you like temperature control because there's really bad insulation in the units (air escapes in through every window frame). Know that the rent is $150-200 more every month than the rent is advertised because of these utilities (not including gas and electricity) and the utilities prices can be changed at any time during your lease agreement, which can be really hard with other prices rising right now. The prices do not really reflect the units themselves unfortunately, although the amenities are really great and management is nice. During our lease, the company Cambridge House uses changed and utilities increased dramatically to these prices. The amenities don't really reflect THESE prices, and the units by far don't. Highly recommend not living near the dog park as it is unfortunately fake turf so even when it's well cleaned it smells pretty awful, and the trash bin for the dog droppings gets pretty full and is unbearable.",

They’re prompt, professional, and skilled, although their workload could be significantly reduced if the units were in better conditions.\n\nUpon moving in, we found many areas that were superficially cleaned but were extremely dirty upon closer inspection. It took us days to clean everything again so that we don’t feel grossed out all the time. However, despite thorough cleaning when moving out, we were still charged the full cleaning fees.\n\nLast but certainly not the least, our rent was increased annually during our two-year stay with no updates nor improvements done to the unit whatsoever. The only reason apartments like this are still in business while being able to charge exorbitant rent and fees is because of the monopolistic housing market in Davis. It’s a shame how much one has to pay for conditions apartment like this has to offer.",

I can definitely say that it is my favorite place in my last 10 years in the US. When I first moved in, I lived in their model unit and later moved to a regular 2BR unit.\n\nExcellent management: The entire team goes above and beyond to address any requests. Every single time I went to them, I have walked out of the office as a happy person. I am moving out of Willows next week and the management was also very helpful with the subleasing process.\n\nCommute to campus: Well connected by P and Q lines. D and K lines are about 6-7 min walk from Willows.\n\nShopping: For any quick needs, K-circle is just across the road. They never say NO to give quarters for laundry.\n\nGym/Laundry/Parking: Gym is small but is open 24 hours. Laundry is also open 24 hours. It is busy in weekends. Parking is free and there are no reserved spots.\n\nPleasant surroundings: Lot of green spaces within the complex. Also, very pleasant to go for a run along the adjacent farms. As a Willows resident, one can also avail membership for the Stone Gate Club for a 10$ fee (per month).",

Every apartment / house I live in from now on will be working against my experience here at the grove.

I was terrified of going into my own kitchen and bathroom!  The wood under the sink in the bathroom was warped and smelled of rotten eggs.  The screens in the windows were held in place by wires and had tears and holes in them.  The bathroom door lock was on the outside instead of inside the bathroom.  The front door was crooked so you had to lift the handle to open and close it and there was still a gap when it was shut. Blinds were missing, and the sliding door to the kitchen was stuck and wouldn't slide at all.\n\nEven worse than all this disgusting stuff was the fact that the management refused to fix these things.  When we were given the keys and the inspection form they promised to fix the sliding door and the blinds but they ended up refusing to fix the door and it took two months to fix the blinds.  When I emailed about the roaches several times and was only given a few traps and sprays for them, the management posted a letter on our door asking us to stop harassing them.\n\nFinally, we were promised going into the lease that we would not be charged a cleaning fee unless the apartment was in  horrible condition.  Before leaving the apartment (only three months after moving in because it was so awful) we received a paper saying that we wouldn't be charged a cleaning fee unless the manager deemed it unclean.  During our checkout the manager said it was cleaner than she'd ever seen the apartment and again said there would be no cleaning fee.  When I was charged $100 out of my security deposit I emailed her complaining that she lied to me on multiple occasions and that we even had a document saying that we would not be charged, however she replied: \"The $100 that we charged you goes to her cleaning supplies and time it takes her, we do not take any of that money. She usually charges $200-$250. You apartment was clean and that is why she didn't charge you as much as she usually does, but the apartment still needs to be \"move-in ready\" for the next tenants. I never said that you wouldn't be charged for cleaning.  As stated in your lease and prior to you moving in I told you the rates for cleaning and the most common cost that are deducted from you security deposit so you could plan accordingly.\"",

Not to mention had several other maintenance issues like screens falling out of windows in the middle of the night.",

The swimming pool area and spa is always clean and ready to use. We love that is is a quiet place with great facilities (great gym too!). A plus is also how they organize small events for Halloween, Thanksgiving (turkey raffle), and even a Santa letter from the North Pole for those who have little kids. My daughter loves to send her letter to Santa and receive a letter for her directly from the North Pole! These details make this place unique. Cannot imagine living in another place in Davis. Kyra and Lauryn are always kind and efficient on their work! I strongly recommend this place for young families, students and professionals in Davis.",

The apartments are beautifully refinished, the exteriors are almost done and will look amazing, and I can't say enough nice things about the staff and maintenance staff. Layce, Marissa, Kyra, and Ricardo are the people you want to have managing the apartment complex you live in.\n\nSome things that put this complex miles above others in the area: gas stoves, washer and dryer in unit with a storage area above (in the 2 bedroom units), plenty of storage, new flooring and countertops, the community, and the staff. We've also enjoyed the greenery areas and mature trees that extend throughout the complex. It goes a long way to reducing stress when you have a beautiful green space just outside your window. Yes, living here is a bit more expensive than other complexes but you get a lot more as well. We had a few problems come up while we lived in Davis (nothing where the apartment was at fault) but it was always reassuring to have such understanding and wonderful people as neighbors and managers. We will miss living here.\n\nAs for the recent reviews about construction: yes there is construction going on in the short term. It was clearly stated in the contract that construction would be going on this year. They also give us plenty of notice when construction would be affecting us. I can understand that living through construction can be disruptive but it's never been terrible and the final results are worth it.",

Unfortunately, after pest control, cockroaches are not completely removed. The scheduled pest control time was 9am, and they came at 3pm that day( I remembered it very clearly, because I stayed out until 8pm to come home). I think they only sprayed the living room briefly. Second, sometimes when we talked to the leasing office, they are not that professional and unfamiliar with what they are doing. Third, the reason why I moved out is they are going to force each unit to pay for the parking area, not assigned for free like before, which is unacceptable for me, especially the overall rent will increase a lot as well.

The majority of the apartments are on the west side of the building which gets constant loud freeway noise at all hours which limits opening the window. The elevator broke multiple times in the winter, once for a fairly extended period of time, which meant carrying my bike up and down 4 flights of stairs each day. Also, expect them to take your entire security deposit ($500) which to me is ridiculous considering my room was undamaged so they must have taken close to $2000 for the \"cleaning\" and repainting the entire common space of the apartment after I moved out, even though we did a pretty decent job of cleaning. Overall it was a fine place to live since I knew no one in Davis but I would not sign a lease here again, given there are other places to find cheap rent.",

Additionally, we repeatedly had problems within our unit, in winter our heat was out for almost a full week making it very uncomfortable and it took them 4 visits to resolve the problem. At the end of our stay we cleaned the apartment fairly and were still charged over 1000$ for “heavy cleaning” with no real explanation.

Until one day I legitimately came into the office and saw Sharon sitting in the window sill of the leasing office with a plant in her lap chit chatting with the other leasing agent there. They also couldn't manage to respond to our emails BUT could manage to send out a google form asking what people wanted for breakfast. Some real productive work there!!!\n\nIt got to a point where my friend's replacement literally dropped out and she had to find a NEW ONE and my other friend's replacement started reconsidering the whole thing because of how long it took for Sharon to DO HER JOB.\n\nSharon, if you're reading this, I genuinely don't know how you still have a job and why they hired you in the first place when you're clearly so beyond incompetent and LAZYYY.\n\nSave yourself the headache and do not rent here.

We paid $266 each person and got back $90 although we have taken care of our apartment more than we would of our own home. We didn't cause any damage or anything else. They LITERALLY USE YOU MONEY TO REPAINT AND CLEAN THEIR UNITS FOR THE NEXT TENANTS.!!! So please do not expect your deposit back and don't even care to keep it clean as that won't help ..haha..keep it clean if you want to not for the deposit money.",

        "text_review": "Came up on the wait-list twice here and there was always some reason I couldn't proceed. First, they told me my income wasn't valid when it was. Waited a month to hear back after she told me she would get back to me. During this time, I called and emailed frequently. No one responded and the voicemail was full each time. When she finally did get back to me after being on leave, the apartment was \"no longer available.\" That manager (Thalia?) is no longer there and I'm wondering if it's because of the way she operated buisness. The second time I applied paid the fees and provided hours of my time to provide info just to be told the tenant moving changed their mind and wasn't moving. I was then asked to apply to a smaller unit which I declined as it wasn't the size unit I was on the wait-list for. What gets me to me most is how the new manager acted as though I had everything in the bag and even showed me a similiar unit to the one I applied for so I had an idea of what my new place was going to look like. Then, after I hadn't heard back in a week or so I had to reach out to learn the unit I applied was no longer available. I emailed and called quite a few times before they finally responded. It was like they were avoiding me. Shortly after this I was sent a letter asking me to confirm  that I wanted to remain in the wait-list when I just had expressed to the management that of course I wanted to stay in the wait-list-- obviously as it wasn't my fault they offered me a unit that wasn't even technically available. I did this via email. I have email proof that I'm supposed to be called when the next unit that is the size I applied for comes up. I honestly have a weird feeling like perhaps management is doing shady things here? Maybe helping friends move in, by skipping over people on the wait-list? I just can't feel positive after being given the run around twice. Who knows, but the ratings probably speak to the quality of this place as well as how management runs things.",

The neighbours are uneducated and constantly harass one another, so if you are a student, please avoid this dump because you cannot focus.  For instance, the cops had to be called on numerous occasions due to late-night altercations next to the complex playground.  Cars are constantly vandalised in the parking lot, and all the past managers have displayed their incompetence. One resident stole the car of another.  If you have children, they will mentally suffocate, since they have no freedom in the unit.  Management will  not even allow them to play, constantly issuing ludicrous notices about \"noise\" in the unit as a result of complaints made by drug addicts who need to be in a psychiatric hospital immediately.  If you do decide to reside at this location, be prepared for numerous inspections under different pretexts, e.g. \"fire department inspection.\" The residents are not screened before they occupy the units.

(YOU can skip to next paragraph I leave this comment bc they asked me to) I think it's one or two weeks ago the weather raised to 110 - 115 and out AC was not functioning for almost a week. The leasing manager did came in and provide us with a portable AC but it does not help under that kind of weather. So I saw there was a rating email that got send over to me so AI rate them with a 1 star and left a not so polite message but very honest one on there. For the record I did not know that this comment will be publicized or get viewed by other superior. And I'm normally a nice person, the AC and the killing temperature forces me to be mean. So after I posted the message the leasing manager talked to my roommate firs and called me to change the comment that I left. the call went okay I agreed that I will change my comment not the rating on that post. BUT I was not able edit the post so the leasing manager said to leave a message here.\n\nIronically, after other superior saw my \"impolite\" message our maintenance problem got fixed within a day, where it normally will take more than 2 weeks to see a person coming. So I just want bring awareness to the resident and the people who want to be here. Your problem will be not be fixed on time unless the company need things from you.

I have spoken with management several times and even called the police on these noise terrorists and there is no consequence for them.\n\nAlso, doing basic things like making sure the elevators remain clean is a hugely difficult ordeal for management to figure out.\nDon't use the elevators on the weekend; if you want to avoid p.t.s.d. from how filthy the trash, cigarette butts and human bodily fluids that build up quickly on the floor of the elevator.\n\nManagement tries to be \"nice\", but if there are any complex problems like the ones written above; then either they are extremely slow to respond or do nothing at all and hope that the victim stops complaining and just goes away. And even gaslight you and imply that it must be your fault or are not seeing things clearly!\n\nIn terms of quality, just ask for a tour of one of the apartments. Notice, within the unit: there is no garbage disposal system nor a dishwasher; nor a washer and dryer for clothes; there is no central heating and air conditioning; there is no individualized water heater. Also, no gas, only an electric stove. Also, notice the perpetual freeway noise from only a hundred yards away that is audible all day long through closed windows.\n\nAvoid this place, if you want to preserve your sanity. Only move here if you are homeless, extremely disabled, or are so destitute you have no other option. Otherwise, find a better place.\n\nWhen I move away from here, I will probably be scarred for life!\n\nThe pros: Some free food is given away weekly.\nA social worker who will listen to you in a neutral, empathetic manner; incapable of helping to resolve any serious issues.\nA bus stop, right in front, yay! You get to hear it every day.\nRelatively inexpensive electricity, due to the mammoth array of solar panels sitting atop every building. You get to park your car, if you can find your spot without have to call a towing company put in place by management due to a lack of parking.",

I do not recommend this apartment for anyone who does like their peace of mind. I do not want to go over all the problems I faced during my stay here, but I will mention this. After my lease ended, I owed them 130 dollars. Instead of reaching out to me, which normally every other apartment complex does. They placed me on collections, and I just a call from collections department. Now this is on my record. This is just totally unacceptable. They placed me on collections 5 days after I left the apartment. They should have contacted me and I would have paid the balance. Disappointed with this behavior from the management.",

        "text_review": "This apartment is an utter disaster in every aspect.\n\n**1. Deposit and Extra Charges**\nDespite thoroughly cleaning the apartment before moving out, the manager claimed we'd be charged a cleaning fee regardless of how spotless we left the place. This was never stated in the lease agreement, which only required maintaining the apartment at the same level of cleanliness as upon move-in. Infuriatingly, the manager stated, \"NOBODY GETS DEPOSIT BACK\" Those were the manager’s exact words. So, if you're considering renting here, brace yourself for not getting your deposit back.\n\nWhat really infuriates me is that we left the apartment cleaner than when we moved in (I have video evidence to prove it). Despite two pre-move-out inspections confirming no issues, they still charged us approximately $400 for cleaning and repainting.\n\nBeyond the deposit, there were nonsensical extra expenses, such as being forced to buy renters insurance—a charge I've never encountered in any other rental experience. Plus, the nearly $150 monthly utility fee was a bitter pill to swallow, especially since most places include it in the rent.\n\nEssentially, if you rent this apartment, you’re on the hook for everything from insurance to utilities to refurbishments, responsibilities that should fall to the owner. The landlord seems to shirk all responsibilities except providing the building.\n\n**2. Subpar Cleaning and Renovations**\nWhen we moved in, the cleaning and renovations were subpar. Corners under cabinets, AC intake filter (figure), gaps next to the bathtub, and the top of the refrigerator were all filthy. Even more ridiculous was the big puddle of urine in the toilet left unflushed. And still, they had the audacity to ask us for cleaning fees.\n\nThe paint job was sloppy and hastily done, evident from the rough patches where the roller had been.\n\nMoreover, the freshly painted walls emitted a pungent odor that took two weeks of airing out to dissipate, posing a potential health risk.\n\n**3. Appliance Nightmares**\nThe entire HVAC system was unbelievably loud, especially during startup. The sound of the relay switching on was so intense it was like a gunshot going off in the room. It could wake the dead, and the refrigerator's constant racket could derail anyone trying to work from home. On top of that, all other appliances were also clearly cheap and noisy.\n\n**4. Betrayal of Current Residents**\nBefore we moved out, the office's renewal offer was $2050 a month, but now new tenants receive an offer of $1875 with six weeks of free rent stated on their website. I can't imagine how disheartening it is for current residents if they find out.\n\n**5. Communication Breakdown**\nWhile the front desk staff was always helpful, they lacked the authority to make decisions. The manager, on the other hand, became completely unresponsive months before our lease ended.\n\nFINAL WARNING: You won’t get what you’ve paid for—high prices in exchange for atrocious service. Not to mention the distance from campus, limited parking, a tiny pool, and a minuscule gym, among other issues.",

I then asked him \"why you told me to come at this time then?\" he said he doesn't remember there's a visit at all. \"You have to wait 1 more month to check out the apartments.\" he said. Well, I think his strategy is, ask you to wait until all the other apartments are out, then you have no choice. Good move.",

        "text_review": "Bottom line:  I would not do business with First Pointe Management\n\nSpeaking in regard to my girlfriend’s unit at Silverstone.  Her unit was rendered uninhabitable by the below tenants who allowed their animals to defecate all over the patio and would not clean it up for months on end.  The smell was unbearable.  We do not know what took place indoors, however, when ever they we’re in town (they were students) she had many problems with roaches, flies, ants, etc. which would magically go away and return with the semester breaks.  Often I saw flies in their windows and once even saw a rat scurry across the sill.\n\nFor six months we politely engaged with the managers, providing daily photos and updates at their request.  Eventually the decision was made to enforce the habitability through a “forced termination of lease.”  This was agreed upon with management verbally and a summary put in writing.  He even agreed to the California Move Out Penalty as she was told not to pay the final month’s rent.  (For those readers not in California, when a lease is forcefully terminated by no fault of the tenant, the landlord must provide the equivalent of one months rent for the purpose of relocation).  As I stated to the manager, in California a tenant being terminated under forced conditions such as habitability are under no obligation to provide notice, my discussion with him was merely a courtesy.\n\nOne more note about these tenants is that they have a history of tormenting their fellow tenants.  Once they stole a pet from another tenant and the police had to get involved.  Any place I have lived, or any unit I own (yes, I’d say I’m a landlord too, but you’re a slumlord…I’m a landlord, and I find your use of the term to describe yourselves offensive) would have evicted them ASAP, damn the cost because I got a reputation to uphold and services to provide…not just a check to cash.\n\nAlso in California, the rent deposit must either be returned, or if not in whole, an itemization of the repairs made must be provided no more than 20 CALENDAR days from the date of move out.  On the 27th day, my girlfriend reached out asking for the status.\n\nDated and postmarked that same day, these crooks had the nerve to send a $22,000 bill for the rent on the duration of the lease plus damages to the unit.   I call that retaliation and it is that act which took us from a peaceful and mutual parting to this mess.\n\nWhen speaking with them, the general response was that they do not allow lease termination.  Read between the lines, give them money and they are under no obligation to fulfil their half of the lease agreement or abide by the state tenant protection acts.  She is on the hook until this unit is rented.\n\nI personally find this all laughable, how little they understand the business that they are in.\n\nRegarding the units themselves.  They are old units in poor condition which First Pointe just sticks bandaid after bandaid on.  Going back a few years, she had an air conditioner which kept going out couldn’t cool  Every service person told them they needed to replace it, but they waited for a line to blow and completely flood the unit below (different tenants at the time) and forcing them to stay in a hotel for a week.\n\nThey call them upgraded, but all they do is stick some light sensors in, some cheap flooring, and cabinet doors.  You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a filthy pig.\n\nBe warned.  Avoid all costs.  Read the reviews, this and similar stories are all too common.  Do not do business with these crooks.",

They continue to upgrade and remodel their units and it really shows.\n\nMy single favorite part of this complex is the safety. I have never experienced a security issue, even after accidentally leaving the patio door to my ground-floor unit open all night. (one of the perks of living a little further from campus)\n\nNext best part is the beauty. The landscaping really is gorgeous and they maintain it very well. It just makes you happy. I haven’t personally seen rats or roaches or other such creepy things around the complex or in my unit. My downstairs unit was directly facing the street so I assumed I’d have to wrestle a rat or two, but thankfully I never did. Nary a rat nor a roach in sight\n\nThe general community that lives here is respectful to one another. I’ve lived in two separate sides of the complex now and haven’t had a noise issue yet.\n\nI felt compelled to write this review because I just received the security deposit refund from my old unit, and it was nearly paid back in full. I’ve never had that happen and was super happy with management.\n\nTo top it off, the leasing staff are rockstars. Specifically Dominic and Kendall. They are always warm and personable and have been extremely patient with me on tenant issues.\n\nThere’s a really great vibe to these apartments.",

Contacted management, their solution was to put traps and get rid of the trapped rats.   Pay over $2k rent and you have to deal with this, when the rats won’t stop coming we hired pest control on our expense and they found a big hole behind the washer area created by rats. We asked management to fix, they sent someone and said it is fixed.\nAt same time we found out our neighbors were having similar issues.\nFew weeks later, it started again and when we looked behind the dryer, the repair was ripped through. Now on contacting management, they replied in email (in writing) that they are aware of rats coming into units due to near by fields and they cannot do much. So have to keep putting traps.\nI just saw that there is another review similar to what I am writing.\nWon’t recommend this place for the Rodent infestation at this property and for having Paper thin walls…you hear your neighbors shower, flush and all other noises in.\nParking… good luck finding parking close to your unit.. there are cars parked in same spot for six months and not moved at all.",

        "text_review": "Look I am going to be professional but I am going to be straightforward. I lived here for 6 months, from January 2018 to June 2018. The complex is very old and they always say that they are remodeling but idk if anything is actually getting done. I shared a two bedroom with a couple and we had roaches, mice, and a reoccuring rat. It's kinda funny too because when I talked to the lady at the front desk she reassured me by saying \"That's only a really common thing on the first floor apartments\".  Wonderful. I feel so secure.\n\nI had to stuff books under my door every night to keep it from coming into my room. On nights that I wasn't home, I would come back and find rat/mouse droppings in my own bed. It literally chewed up my carpet (see photo attached) as well as my clothes and electronics. I had notified the management about this more than once and their only course of action was to set out sticky traps. I had absolutely no food in my room, but it was very interested in my cotton clothes. We had to store all of our food in plastic snapping bins.\n\nI woke up one morning to a bleeding mouse struggling and crying on a sticky trap on my kitchen counter... where I prepare my food!!! We notified management again and specifically asked for no more sticky traps because I couldn't deal with killing the mouse on my own or watching it suffer. I came home from school and they \"surrounded the perimeter\" with more sticky traps. Ugh.\n\nThe apartment is in a good location, but there are also people who come at night late from partying and think it's cool to hang outside of your window and chat at 3:30am. That's great, if you like to party but I worked weekends and I really needed my sleep. I actually resorted to staying that night at a friends apartment in Davis instead sometimes, because it was quieter.\n\nA fast forward on the other events I experienced in my short stay was our AC went out, our dishwasher was leaking water every time we used it, I experienced hassle over my monthly payment, the pool and hot tub was closed for most of my stay. Oh- and my bike lock was cut and my bike was stolen there, too!!!\n\nI had an issue with my monthly payment where I accidentally charged my bank for two months rent at once and I wanted to just cancel and redo it (what student can afford that??). The ladies told me that they actually have no control over the site they use to collect rent and that they couldn't do anything to help me. Under the advice of one of them I had to call my bank and cancel the payment formally. I thought after all of that I was in the clear- next week I get a letter of a $50 fee for canceling a check with the apartments.  It would have been nice to know that was going to happen. I can't believe an automated site charges that much for a cancellation. When I went back to question it, the lady at the desk told me she was \"doing me a favor\" because I was supposed to get some other kind of fee too and she \"waived it\" for me. It's hard to believe.\n\nOh and I almost forgot. I'm pretty sure that Silverstone has an asbestos problem. They say nothing to you when you sign the paper work, but I read the fine print and it's in their disclosure. Make sure you ask if you go in. Now that I think of it, I had a black mold on my ceiling where my AC vent was. Sorry no pics of that.\n\nThe only reason I went out of my way to write this review is that it's a little sketch that there is only one google review for this apartment when it's been around for so long- right? I read reviews when I was living there and they followed suit to my experience. I feel like people deserve to know. Everyone has a different experience, sure. I just don't want anyone to make the same mistakes that I did.",

The management treats tenants with disrespect, ignores any requests, and even raises their voice if you demand fairness. There is zero privacy – they collect your personal information, flood you with spam, and possibly sell your data to third parties.\n\nTheir financial policies are pure deception. They constantly try to squeeze more money out of you, hidden fees appear out of nowhere, and rent increases happen without explanation. Meanwhile, the apartments are so old and run-down that they aren’t worth even half of what they charge.\n\nAnd here’s their biggest scam – the so-called \"first month free.\" But nobody falls for it, because the price of this outdated complex is higher than renting an entire house! That says it all.\n\nThe reputation of this place is completely ruined, and the management is solely to blame. They think they can manipulate people, violate their rights, and collect their personal data without consequences. But sooner or later, they will have to answer to the law.\n\nIf you don’t want trouble – stay far away from these apartments!",

I found that the air condition was 40 years old and looked extremely dirty. The apartment sent in a guy and tried to convince me it was a good machine and when I pointed out the thick dirt on the vents . He told me it was clean. So I took a picture of the vent and sent to Gaby. She said it was because we as tenants were not clean. I was a bit scared with the dirt when I stood on a chair and looked inside. There was a thick layer of dirt there which scared me a bit. Who knows what kind of mold and bacteria in them . So I asked for an air quality check. They told me I should pay myself and it was at least 400 dollars. So I tested using a kit I bought from Amazon. The mold it developed was really scary. No one can use their condition when it was filthy as this. The communication with the apartments was extremely difficult. They used all tactics to delay , avoid problem solving and tried to find fault with you instead.",

        "text_review": "I’ll start by saying this—I know I’m being a “Karen,” but that’s just how bad this property’s management team has been.\n\nIt seems this property used to be a great place to live, but that all changed with the current management, as other reviews confirm.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not referring to Miguel, the maintenance man—he’s fantastic and works hard. The issue is the actual management team. They are unprofessional and more focused on minor, petty issues (like small items left on porches) than addressing real, serious concerns.\n\nI ended my lease early due to unsafe living conditions. Rather than taking accountability, management contacted their attorney, who likely advised them to clean up their act. Despite their failures, they refused to waive any part of my lease termination fee, ignoring their responsibilities under California Civil Code §1941.1, which outlines their obligation to maintain habitable conditions.\n\nWhat’s worse, they are extremely biased toward tenants. We were unlucky enough to live in the unit right next to their office, so we were under constant scrutiny. They nitpicked everything about our unit while being far more lenient with tenants further away. Instead of walking the property consistently to enforce rules fairly, they targeted us disproportionately. To top it off, I’m fairly certain one of their clubhouse cameras was pointed directly at our porch door, which feels like an invasion of privacy and potentially violates California Penal Code §632 regarding recording private activities without consent.\n\nHere are just a few examples of their gross mismanagement:\n\n1. Dangerous Neglect of Repairs: They failed to fix a broken, hazardous railing for months. They were fully aware of the issue, as they wrapped the railing in caution tape multiple times. Despite acknowledging the danger, they never actually fixed it, leaving tenants at risk.\n2. Unsafe Night Conditions: Broken lights and inadequate lighting left large areas dark and unsafe, leading to theft and making it dangerous to walk around at night.\n3. Unreasonable Pet Policies: While the complex allows pets (which is great), the management team complained about barking, claiming it was distracting to their work. No residents ever reported issues with barking—it was solely a problem for management, which is completely unreasonable.\n4. Unsanitary Conditions: Turkey poop is everywhere, creating health risks and making the property unpleasant to live in. They seem completely incapable or unwilling to address this issue.\nCockroach Infestation: If you venture out at night, be prepared to encounter—and kill—countless cockroaches. This issue alone makes the property unsanitary and unlivable.\n5. Aggressive Lease Renewals: Management pressures tenants to renew leases early, claiming rates will increase. However, they’re already among the most expensive options in the area.\nThe good news? Davis has plenty of other, better housing options with competent management teams and safer, cleaner environments. This property is simply not worth the stress.\n\nSave yourself the headache and find a property with management that prioritizes the safety, comfort, and fairness that tenants deserve.",

It really feels like the complex is designed with residents' needs in mind.\n\nI also want to give a huge shoutout to Andrew, who is truly an incredible employee. I am a bit baffled by a previous review I read on here, as he has been nothing but kind to me. He’s always so friendly, professional, and great at what he does. Whether it’s helping tenants with requests, tending to issues around the complex, and even helping me with my lease, he always goes above and beyond.\n\nI understand I have been a bit difficult at times and for that, I apologize. The entire team here has been nothing but patient, kind, and understanding with me, and I really appreciate it more than I can say. With the amount of students that live here, they do an amazing job making sure that every tenant is satisfied.

They take advantage of the student population by overcharging on rent and fees while neglecting the complex.\n\nThe rent for a 2 bedroom is significantly higher compared to what else you can get in the area. No dishwasher, no microwave, broken sliding doors and locks, poor tiling in bathroom. Water is never at a decent temperature. Either boiling or freezing cold. Even the lower floor patio is a sham. Rain water goes right through the boards leaving everything soaked and moldy, so don’t get excited about having furniture out there (great for plants, I guess).\n\nShe’s leaving soon, but the previous property manager we had was very condescending and rude. She wouldn’t put up any notices, would ignore maintenance requests or say she forgot to put them in. She made the experience of living there significantly worse. Literally laughed in our faces when our toilet became uninhabitable because “toilet water on the floor isn’t an emergency”. The maintenance guy was nice, but there’s only one for the entire complex.\n\nOne of the few places where you don’t even get one free parking space, you either have to pay $25-$35/mo. for a space of use street parking. The previous property manager lied saying there’s plenty of parking, but there’s not.\n\nThey charge a fee for a laundry card and had issues with their card reader not working. It’s been over 4 months since the issue was first brought up and nothing has changed. It took months for us to even have them put up signs to tell tenants that they don’t work before they put their clothes in.\n\nThe bike lock area is useless. Can barely lock your front wheel.\n\nThe only bonus to this place is that it’s close to campus and there’s a jacuzzi. Absolutely not worth it, regret signing the lease everyday I stay here. avoid at all cost.",

Heres the story that just did it for me. I went home for the weekend and the management decided to install AC inside my room without notice. The worse part was, they decided to sand down their BAD installation and got dust literally EVERYWHERE. There is a thick layer of dust on all my stuff. They did not bother to cover ANY of my furnitures and just left it as is. Whatever you do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. They need to seriously replace their management. They have no respect for others properties.",

I loved that they had treats during the holidays and for finals as well. It was nice because we all know finals are stressful and they cared about the students by having treats and at times, a food truck. I loved the location. Getting around Davis was easy with the convenient location. Overall, had a pleasant experience.",

Denied ESA initially because we had to have separate conditions for each animal and disclose it to management.\nStudio and single bedroom ac units don’t keep the place cool.\n1 bedroom ac isn’t in the bedroom\nTold us they needed to come into the unit for a “plumbing leak” but then proceeded to take pictures of everything and inspect for damages.\nTrain is annoying and goes on all day. Doesn’t happen to much at night but every day it gets annoying.\nPool isn’t 24/7 it closes early in the night.\nParking is a nightmare.\nOverall wouldn’t recommend since there are better options for close to the same price",

Around January, when the wet season came around, we all discovered mold covering our bedroom walls behind our beds and furniture. When we brought it to the attention of management, they were extremely unclear and slow in decision-making, and threatened to make us pay for remediation. The situation became very tense, and they told us we’d have to throw out all of our furniture if we wanted to stay in the apartment. They finally gave us the option of exiting our lease and we took them up on it. We were under the impression they were going to rip up the floors and walls to find the source of the mold and remediate it, but only 2 weeks later we saw the apartment up on the market again. Overall, they created a very stressful environment, especially for college students who’s lives are stressful enough. Between having to get lawyers involved and finding emergency housing, it felt like they were taking advantage of us. I would not advise leasing here.",

        "text_review": "My daughter and roommates lived here for a couple of years. They complained about mold on several occasions. First they were told they were not cleaning the bathroom ceiling well enough. Then maintenance just painted over the mold.\nMy daughter had to leave Davis due to severe medical issues before this latest lease was up. We were not able to get her out of her lease unless she found another roommate to take her place. We continued playing until this month.\nWe went to move the rest if her belongings out and the while plane smells musty from mold. After moving her bed, we found mold  under her\nBed  and on the baseboards as well. UNACCEPTABLE. We are now having to throw away everything that cannot be cleaned, including a new mattress.\nFor a place that charges roughly $2800 with utilities charged, this is disgusting. Below is what mold can do to a person. My daughter had every single symptom.\nMold toxicity can manifest in different ways in people. It's more commonly linked to physical problems, such as difficulty breathing, fatigue, and headaches, but research shows that it can present itself in a psychiatric way, too. This includes brain fog, depression, anxiety, problems concentrating, and insomnia.\n\nWe will be pursuing this further. Did anyone else experience mold problems?\n\nAlso, the management told the young girls to keep their bathroom window open to help with the mold, which they did. One night a roommate was in the bathroom and there was a man peering through the window. He had stolen a chair off the porch to use to peek in. Management was alerted. Not only did they not contact the girls back, they never alerted the  other tenants if a peeping Tom. Parents our young kids live here. The police came, but never found the guy, only the chair that he used to look into their bathroom.  This place is NOT SAFE!!!!",

So I never had to worry traveling far for food!\n\nTheir manager, Chaprix, is truly a wonderful, funny, and super helpful person! Whenever I had a problem, she would try her best to immediately rectify it. She is super supportive that she would have a small brunch for students (but everyone was definitely encouraged to come) during their final weeks!

        "text_review": "ZERO STARS is my true rating for Dowling Properties. Just like most property management companies in Davis, Dowling is run by a bunch of con artists and cheapskates. Where do I begin?\n\nThey tried to charge us $25/month on their online portal than our lease stated. When we pointed it out, they took no accountability.\n\nThey have contracts with “vendors” aka their friends’ and families’ companies to do unnecessary yard work and construction every week. Love those 7am lawn mowers right outside my window!\n\nThey refuse to make even the bare minimum repairs to keep our house safe and structurally sound. The house is 60 years old, and it shows.\n\nI have bonked my head so hard on the old AC unit they left in the window that I had to go to the ER. I have slashed my arm open several times on wood board with nails that are hanging off of the totally janky fence.\n\nIf you ask for any repairs, expect an attitude. They treat you like you’re an inconvenience to them rather than their source of income. Complete scum bags!",

        "text_review": "I have rented an apartment from Dowling for the last two years and recently moved out. They were friendly, helpful, and their repair person always responded to things quickly. I'm not usually one to have positive feelings towards landlords/property management companies, but this one seemed to earnestly aim to treat us well.  An example - The washer or dryer broke 2-3 times while we lived there (as expected. Those machines served 4 units with lots of students in each.), and each time they were fixed or replaced quickly, often the day after we notified them. We will be getting our deposit back soon, and my interactions with them so far have led me to believe they won't be taking advantage of us in what we get back. The primary people with have interacted with at Dowling are Eric Ferch for most communication and Kelly for maintenance.",

They are always really quick with responding to us through phone and email. They always are very helpful with maintenance issues as well. Everyone I've interacted with at the office in person or over the phone has been very personable and helpful. Would definitely recommend them as one of the better property managements in Davis.",

        "text_review": "I was disappointed in my experience as a renter with Dowling Properties. Renting directly from the property owner was great. However, once Dowling Properties entered the picture, it all went to hell.\n\nThe cost of rent went up dramatically in order to pay Dowling Properties' fees, yet I received no benefit from them whatsoever. All of their correspondence with me was unprofessional and lacking attention to detail. They told me my rent was overdue when in fact it had already been paid on time and sent me an email intended for my next door neighbor. The email chain included the email addresses of all the tenants with late payments.\n\nAfter I had the unit thoroughly cleaned, they charged me extensively for cleaning fees and carpet shampooing after I moved out. Note that the carpets were stained and smelled of urine when I originally moved in and the place was not clean at that time. I brought it up to a cleaner standard than it was initially. They took nearly all of my deposit. After I've lived there for multiple years with normal wear and tear, they charged me for painting and other basic expenses. I maintained the property, always paid my rent on time and they tried to nickel and dime me for things that should be paid for by the property owner. I cannot believe they won't replace the carpets when they were old and dirty when I originally moved in.",
