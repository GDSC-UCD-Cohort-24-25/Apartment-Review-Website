302,"Cozy apartments. Quiet. Washer and dryers in unit which is a big plus. However, management often didn't address work orders to fix ""minor"" issues like a leaky faucet.",3,Barry Yu
302,"Don’t move here. This place will take as much of your money as possible. Rent is steep, pet rent is an astronomical $75/month, and utilities are flat fee of $110/month. I paid a $1200 deposit and they kept $500 for bogus charges like painting the unit, which of course wasn’t mentioned on my move out inspection.

Expect to deal with multiple property managers and maintenance techs. I lived there a year, and interacted with at least 4 property reps and as many maintenance techs. The staff member who handled my refund, Rebeca, promised to follow up on my concerns, then stopped responding to my emails.

The only saving grace for this place is central heat/air, dishwasher, and washer/dryer in unit. But honestly, none of that was worth the hassle and headache of losing so much money. There are other complexes in Davis with better prices and customer service.",2,Teresa Koro
302,"I lived in this apartment complex for 2 years before new management took over in 2017. After the transition, the new management put financial and psychological pressure on the previous residents and forced many of them out of their apartments in order to make surface-level changes to the complex and hike the rent up by $500 a month. I do not begrudge them the right to remain competitive in the Davis rental market.

What I do condemn is the way in which they continuously showed blatant disregard for the residents they were forcing to leave. They had a work crew in and out of my apartment for the entire month of July. The entire fiasco ended up costing me the equivalent of $250 in lost apartment access and electricity costs (the crew needed to have the apartment door open and plug in power tools). I couldn't use my shower for two days. They compensated me $50.

Though the new management replaced the cabinets, floors, appliances (in some units), built little fences, added a fitness room, and painted the outside of the apartments green, they made these changes at the expense of other more pressing concerns. I know from a member of the crew working in my apartment, that a few of the units have rodent problems.

I urge you, if you have another choice for housing in Davis, please do not move in to Cottages on Fifth. The management has no incentive to care about the well being of their residents, and they will try to take as much of your money as they can. These apartments may look attractive, but they are not worth the price that the management is asking.

I now live in a complex I enjoy much more. The management is responsive, kind, and welcoming. The apartments are well built and well kept. I pay roughly the same amount. It is possible to find a better home in Davis. Please do not give Cottages on Fifth your money.",1,Amplify Sacramento
302,"I have lived there for 1 year it is so expensive 1950$ not included anything even wife! Location is not bad. Bus Station you have to cross the street. Maintenance is good. However, with this price, you can have a great apartment. There is no office. Their work stuff is not good. There are no room students that has a computer and printer like every complex. Unfortunately, I have to live there because I come to Davis very late and the good apartment has gone!",1,نورة محمد
302,"I loved the scenery and layout of the whole property and found the amenities that come with the apartment to be super convenient! Stepping right in through the front door I was already able to imagine living there with the help of the office staff and their suggestions since I will be working remotely. The overall feel for making it my new home was definitely cozy, comfortable & calm. Can’t wait to sign the papers!",5,Chrizelle Anselmo
320,"I've lived in this apartment for years, and it's by far my favorite place I've ever stayed. The environment is lovely, creating a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. The staff are always quick to respond and incredibly helpful, making living here a truly enjoyable experience. Highly recommended!",5,Olivia Liang
320,"I love living at Sycamore Lane. The location is amazing and love my apartment. They are super responsive to service requests too! Everyone is so nice, I love the managers they are so friendly and welcoming. They also put on fun days with food for everyone during finals and holidays!! Love love it here",5,Erin Munz
320,"Sycamore is such a great place to live in especially for students. The staff is so nice and are so quick to help or fix anything we need! They offer so many fun socials, the study lounge always has free coffee and printers, and they have made living here sophomore year great!",5,Diane Delrieu
320,"Living in sycamore land has improved my college experience through the ability to have a fabulous study lounge and workout room, AND POOL, right at the tip of my fingers. Living here sophomore year was couldn’t have been better due to the fact it was 5 minutes biking to get to each class and Trader Joe’s in walking sight. Love it here !!",5,Quinn Vasquez
320,So far I have had a wonderful experience at Sycamore Lane Apartments!! The staff are all so kind and the apartments themselves are very nice and clean. The staff hosts free meals every now and then with great food. I plan to live here for the rest of my time spent in Davis!,5,Ingrid Lindblom

338,Enflmatory management. Gaslighting disabled tenants. Repairs avoided for years some never fixed. Dangerous dwelling.,2,oo oo
338,"As the mother of a renter at Cesar Chavez, I am reporting on the experience of my disabled daughter.
John Stewart, owner of Cesar Chavez Plaza & king of cheap housing all over California, may be dead (Sept. 2020) but his dark philosophy of hassling renters, or at least: ignoring them, lives on. Apparently his approx 1300 selected employees stay because they're ok with enforcing his under the table rules.  RULES?  --- You're not going to get things fixed promptly. If your appliance breaks, expect them to bring in a limping one from another of their units.  If the manager at Cesar Chavez doesn't like you, she'll find reasons to write you up--and if you're on Sec 8 housing permit...this threatens your eligibility, i.e. your housing security. YET, there are tenants freely selling drugs, fighting/screaming, etc --police come periodically.

Rats are also tenants at Cesar Chavez. -----       Rats slide under the hot water heater closet door ( on her 2nd floor deck)then they lounge there in the sun, nibbling off the potted plants, waiting for the door into living room to open. Under Calif law, owner/manager is responsible for addressing unsanitary conditions: rat infestation, for example. This isn't happening, no matter how many complaints. Why doesn't daughter put a trap where hot water heater is? It's kept locked by manager.

Community spirit? The 'lockdown' wiped out Monday night gatherings of fellow renters, for a sit-down meal (supplied by local organizations). Thankfully, a new social worker has been hired and she (Lori/Laurie) is BEST thing going at Cesar Chavez apts...yet she's overworked.
If my disabled daughter had another option she would've moved months ago.",1,Kunzang R
338,"Would like to rate it zero stars solely on the management. Intrusive and hostile, the manager chases guests away with her broken engrish.",1,Cameron Laplace
338,"I live here.  Window  blinds on all window. Central Ac & heating, very quiet, very affordable.",5,Larry Yee
356,"I am moving out tomorrow after two years living here in a one-bedroom with my roommate. It's been a good experience!

The one-bedroom we are in is not the updated model, and the age shows, but it has been kept clean and well-maintained. My favorite part about this apartment is the storage space! There is a TON of storage space for a one-bedroom, which is really nice. The con to the apartment, and I think this may go for all the apartments, is the lack of natural light.

Management here is really friendly and is responsive to emails, and maintenance responds very quickly and does a great job. The complex is quiet and neighbors have been polite. One pro is that there is direct access to the Greenbelt, and there is a Unitrans bus stop right outside with a bus that comes every 15 minutes on weekdays (pre-COVID). It is expensive, but not more so than other apartments in Davis. Overall, I recommend!",5,J. Roberto
356,Management is super nice,5,Kanin Chuengsatiansup

375,"Believe these reviews! If I could give it less than one-star I would. When I first considered moving here, I saw the bad reviews and thought “maybe it’s because it’s mostly angry people that write reviews, positive experiences are usually not vocalized”. I was very wrong. The location of this complex is in a dangerous area of Davis. My car was broken into over winter break. The apartment itself is stuffy and run down but literally painted over to make it look new, definitely just a way to put lipstick on a pig. Management was unresponsive and hostile. An example of this is, consistently changed the locks to “community resources” like the gym as a way to punish all residents for “taking equipment”. At the end of our stay we left the apartment spotless, no damage to the walls, floors, or amenities. They kept our security deposit and charged us an additional $200. When asked what the charges were they provided an itemized receipt of “work that was done on repairs”. They said this work was standard procedure for every resident that moves out. By that logic, do not expect to get your security deposit back. They will take it from you. As it customary, they will respond under this negative review, please do not be fooled by their performative professionalism. It is likely they will not change. Save yourself time, money, and grief.",1,Katelyn Magdaleno
375,"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND :)
One of the WORST management I have ever experienced. I think some of the fellow neighbours would agree too.

A few examples, managers are uncontactable, missing from the office or no answer email; constant miscommunication, they don’t read but rather reply the keywords by their guidelines, not even answering my questions and concerns; nonsense schedule on maintenance, they replace the locks of facility without informing us and we are responsible to make the effort for replacing a new set of keys. It happened 2-3 times during my whole stay in 2 years. Is my unit out of their service area or what? How can you “forget” every single time?; old equipment, I have never successfully used the printer once; ridiculous parking policy, Davis is known as a college town and students tend to leave town for holiday. However they often require a vehicle moving during the holiday. Have you ever considered about your customers? Apparently not.

I can go on and on, their management is bad. Don’t get me wrong, the worker/handy man are helpful and friendly. I just couldn’t bear with the way they manage.

Utilities are also expensive here, I paid almost the same price when I’m away for holiday the entire month. They have the breakdown and said it’s common share or something. I find that ridiculous.

If you think you can bear with a bad management, be my guest. It’s a nice quiet neighbourhood.",1,Lucas Chuk
375,"I lived here from July 2020 to June of 2023. At first glance, the one bedroom apartment was nice. However, on move in day it was clear the apartment hadn’t been cleaned, or prepped as promised. The AC was broken, and bathroom drawers were dirty. The apartment was also not the one I had been promised, and tiny. Of course this was back in 2020 so I did try to understand the lack of communication. I was in shock at how dark and small the one bedroom was, for the price they charged. I’m sure it’s even more now.

Throughout my three years at Ellington there was problem after problem. The bathroom has black mold, and they had to tear out the entire bathroom counter. But all they did was kind of clean it, then reattach the old piece which still had black mold on it. I truly believe many of my health issues that arose, was due to black mold that the magnet didn’t seem to care about fixing. Then our washer, dryer started leaking like crazy. They did replace that. But the washer/dryer system is crappy (once again for the price they are charging here).

We were good tenants, and paid rent on time every single month. When my partner and I finished college he got a job a few months earlier than planned. We tried to break the lease but they still charged us for the entirety of the lease agreement’s rent. Fine, but then to make matters worse they came up with a bunch of false charges when we moved out. I had already moved out of state, and traveled all the way back just to take care of the final walkthrough and checkout. Gabby, the man anger was beyond rude and condescending. She also is the one that came up with all of these bogus charges, we ended up owing money instead of getting our deposit back.

We left the place clean, and in good condition. The only charge I was expecting was for some carpet that had been damaged. Anyways, I felt scammed with the random charges that didn’t make sense at the end. I also felt like they ignored the black mold problem, and constant car break ins when I lived there. I got my catalytic converter stolen right in front of my apartment and had multiple other break ins after that. The management really did nothing even when I told them that the parking spaces were super dark and there needed to be more light or cameras. Oh, and parking is a joke. You get one spot assigned to you (that is paid for) but otherwise there was never any parking, and they’ll tow your car if it’s parked anywhere it’s not supposed to be for even 30 seconds.

Awful experience, and it’s like they slapped new paint and crappy vinyl wood flooring over moldy, old structures. Definitely wouldn’t reccomend this place to anybody, especially with how I was treated after being a good tenant for three years! What a joke.",1,Kristen Gewecke
375,"Arnold came to my apartment and promptly cleaned the shower, fixed the living room blinds and replaced the bedroom screen.Thank you!",5,Cheryl Hafer
375,"Living in Ellington was a pleasure for the 2 years I was there. I barely had any issues when moving in, and any I did have were taken care of quickly. No cleanliness issues upon moving in, everything was bug free.

Management was quick to respond to any emails or inquiries I had and showed genuine care for my concerns.

Vickie, Gabby, and Arnold were all excellent to rent from. I'd rent again if I ever moved back to Davis!",5,Branden Barnett
395,"I have lived here for about a year, and I am enjoying my experience! The office staff are very helpful and accomidating, and the aparemtments themselves are well kept and plesent to live in. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars, however, is that the walls are fairly thin here, so hearing your neighbors when they have gatherings is not uncommon. Other than that, living at University Square is great! Great location, reasonable pricing, and a nice facility overall.",4,Adenine Kao
395,"I have lived here for 1 year. The management staff are nice and efficient. The complex has a 24h our policy that keeps people quiet. If you are looking for a calm, college complex, this is a great place.",4,Antonio Cembellín Prieto
395,Both my girlfriend and I have tried calling this company for vital information and neither of our calls have ever been answered or returned.,1,Sean Derby
290,"Lived here for 6 years and really didn’t have any complaints! I regret not interacting more with other residents, as the complex is pretty quiet and peaceful. People usually are just minding their own business. Any interactions were always friendly though!

Management was very helpful and always timely on responding to questions. Tarri helped with our move out/lease buy out process so that we were able to get everything done in about 2 weeks. Very grateful for all of the help.

Take advantage of the amenities and interact with the front office and residents if you live here! Everyone is very nice. Great location and very cozy option.",5,Richard Jia
290,"I am currently abroad and due to some travel restrictions issues, I cannot return to the US in the near future. I want to end the lease with the apartment and pay a buyout fee. But the manager has been refusing to help me with the issue, and insisting that I have to pay all the rent until the end of August. That is 8 months of rent and a lot of money for me. I don’t understand how this apartment could be so greedy to make every bit of money from the tenants. They gave a ridiculous reason that buyout fee has to be paid in some specific form (money order) and not available from abroad. First of all, the contract never specified this requirement, and now they are making up terms and conditions by themselves. Secondly, they claim that I can pay all the 8 months of rent from abroad, but not the buyout fee. How is that logically possible? Thirdly, it is the management’s responsibility to assist with the tenant for the moving out process, and they don’t seem to understand that their job is to actually help tenants when issues arise, instead of sitting in the office and collecting money. It has been extremely difficult and frustrating to communicate with them, the manager seems reluctant to do their job to help me pay the buyout fee and move out. Please stay away from this management.",1,Y
290,"Living here was an absolute nightmare. We lasted only two months before we realized we had to get out for the sake of our mental well-being. The noise was relentless, with our upstairs neighbors hosting gatherings of 15 people or more, making it impossible to have any peace. To make things worse, sounds from other units traveled through the thin walls, so we could hear people having adult intimacy at all hours of the day, adding to the uncomfortable living environment.

The bathroom vents are all interconnected, meaning that if someone decided to hotbox their apartment, the smell would seep through the vents into our space, making it impossible to avoid. The entire building felt filthy, with dead cockroaches and even animal waste in the hallways—a clear sign of poor maintenance and disregard for basic cleanliness.

Our unit felt grimy and outdated, with an especially unpleasant bathroom. The tub appeared to have been sloppily painted over multiple times, and the cramped layout made it feel even more claustrophobic and dirty. On top of everything, we were told by management that trains wouldn’t be an issue at night, which was a flat-out lie. The trains stop and brake right outside the building around 11 PM, so sleep was often interrupted by the loud, jarring noise.

In short, this was a terrible experience from start to finish, and I’m incredibly relieved we were able to move to a place that actually feels livable.",1,noah fick
290,Stay away at all costs. New management is an absolute joke. Left me without bathroom electricity for over a year stating that the only way to fix it was to vacate me out until they could complete the repairs. I couldn’t afford to be relocated so it was never fixed. Almost two years go by and I ask to finally be vacated to allow me to move out of my horrible lease early. They refused and said the repairs could be done in a few hours. Finally I come to move out and they cancel my apartment portal preventing me from paying my final month of rent. The day they sent me my invoice they sent the amount to collections. I’ve never missed a payment and have fantastic credit so had I not seen through their scam there could have been major repercussions. They state the reason they sent it to collections was because my final statement was sitting in the mailbox I returned my keys to. Who sends important information to a mailbox that someone just turned over the keys for?! Overall the new staff is absolutely pathetic and this company needs to be investigated and be held accountable for how they are treating people. Everyone I made friends with in the apartments has since left and they are desperate for new tenants but beware and stay away at all costs!!,1,Wyatt Elmore
290,My mom is a senior citizen and doesn't use technology that often but she asked me to specifically get on here and leave a review for the maintenance staff at Academy Lane. She is very grateful for the quick response from the office staff(Tessla) and the maintenance staff at Academy Lne for repairing a broken window frame quickly(within a day).,5,Paul Morgan
291,"Honestly, I would give this place a four star if it wasn't for them raising the rent for housing. I would say, for the $1100 or so rent, the place is everything I'd expect and need. The atmosphere is nice, the noise isn't too bad, and the provided furniture + appliances are a great deal. I would also like to add that they have frequent events to boost the community experience. The main issue is that, for $1300, I could be living alone with a better layout, benefits, and exclusion of three other people living with me. I doubt a google review will change management's mind, but that price is outrageous.",3,Offline Market
291,so imagine giving out all your EV parking permits to non EVs. So me someone who has a EV but does not have a EV permit but instead have a normal parking permit (which is the same price as a EV permit) because they low key do not know what they are doing. And get ticketed for using the charger ( i pay for the electricity rates). THE PERMITS ARE THE SAME PRICE JUST LET ME USE THE EV CHARGERS. And theres always to many EV chargers are always half empty.,1,Kevin Do
291,"The worst apartment complex management in the area. Yes, they are new and shiney. But only people who desperately looking for housing, they end up living here. The lease documents are filled with spelling mistakes. Make unreasonable demands in these documents. False advertisement at its best.
The maintenance never does anything and do a half ass job at best. Hot water is constantly off with no explanation. They don't provide any safety to the tenants. I filled multiple complaints with nothing leading to any actions. Package gets lost, IT is a nightmare, multiple vandalism took place. The parking service is constantly giving people tickets even though we pay for parking.
People should really take legal actions against them. I know, I want to.",1,Farhana Sharmin
291,Just run. Worst experiences ever  for bad altitude of office and getting into waitlist for a parking spot for 3 months and receiving tickets for over $200. Imagine living in an apartment without parking spot. And the sound insulation was terrible two. Biggest scam of UC Davis housing.,1,Yunqi Zhao
291,"Moved here earlier this month after transitioning from an undergrad to a grad student. I only have positive things to say. The staff have been extremely welcoming and take care of any maintenance concerns in a prompt manner.

The studios may appear to be small, but if you get creative with the layout, they are actually quite spacious. I agree that the furniture that is provide is only the bare minimum, but I added a small futon and some accent pieces to bring the space together. Having all utilities included is a huge plus, though the rent is on the higher end. Overall, I look forward to the rest of my stay here.",4,Kaashvee Kumar
292,"I went for a tour of the property and established an 11 o'clock appointment time. The rental office was 15 minutes late to the appointment.

I had asked and expressed interest in a studio apartment and could only tour a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom.

When I did my self-guided tour with the 15 extra minutes.  The apartment complex seems to look like a refurbished hotel that has been turned into an apartment complex. Many of the residents have garbage on their back porches, facing outdoors. The streets and many of the buildings paints look old and wet. The 3 story apartment complex smelled of mild mildew.

For 1850 a month with a trash and water bill of $105.  Pets were $80 deposit fee each. Additionally, as the complex is geared towards students, they are not allowing summer move ins.My short advice is go somewhere else.",2,Scott
292,it's cool to chill and i've had so many good memories here but they outpriced my friend sophia 😞,3,Sam Machtolff
292,"I've been a resident here for a while, having lived in three separate apartments at Lakeshore. I have nothing but good things to say. The rooms are a great size, with more closets than I know what to do with. My neighbors have always been really kind and the complex in general is pretty quiet. Although Davis is a college town, there's a great mix in demographic here, with some students, but with a lot of families, retirees, etc., as well. The property manager is very approachable and takes a genuine interest in her residents. While I haven't had too many maintenance requests, when I have, they've resolved the issue quickly and were mindful of my pets. Overall, I have to say that my UC Davis experience has been made better with Lakeshore and looking back, I would definitely live here again.",5,Phoenix Gaylor

293,"Lived here for two year, moved in when they were switching companies, the house wasn’t even fully cleaned out when we moved in but can’t get in contact with the previous company who owned Avalon. One year later when our kitchen almost flooded, it took them three weeks to come over and check on us. Now after I have moved out, they are charging an unreasonable high move out cleaning fee and refusing to communicate with me, it has been two weeks since I sent an email to communicate about the fees. They are charging over $2000 to replace the carpet and the wall paintings. Unbelievable.",1,Jiawei Gao
293,"Pretty comfy apartment. Easy walk to Safeway and bus stop. With new management company in mid 2023 lots of turmoil. Now they seem to nickle and dime tenants with new fees for insurance, utilities, garbage and very strict about how and when rent is paid.",4,Howard Chuang
293,"It used to be the best apartment in Davis. Now I think it's one of the worst. The new management is really irresponsible. The management person likes to teach the tenant how to be a good person and not complaining, especially when you send an email to them just to ask for a normal maintenance.",1,Brandon
293,"Lived there for 3+ years. First, I will admit, location is nice and maintenance staff is great. However, pricing is outrageous: the whole unit is responsible for the rent so if you run into any problems with your roommates not paying rent, you're screwed since the office will not do anything. For those curious on their response to Covid: they did the bare minimum to help themselves, not the tenants. Also, I got charged for turnover fees $1000+ with no explanation why.",1,Jonathan Diep
293,"Property was bought by FPI Management from a local owner during Summer 22. New management sucks at being helpful in every way (non responsive on email and phone calls) and has told us explicitly to contact lawyers if we want to discuss anything. They also will only respond to emails regarding money. 2/10 only for location, overall would not recommend.",1,Bryan Wijaya
294,"loved living here! I do think I managed to get a good updated unit since the building is old and some units aren’t renewed but I am so happy living here and it is a great complex. The place is close to campus and trader joes and bus lines. They are also great with the pet policy, and my place was updated prior to my move in with new paint, new wood floors, and new carpet in the bedroom and closet. The dishwasher and other appliances are very great too. The unit is spacious and rent price is relatively great compared to places around. The new property manager Maria is very very helpful and responsive and prompt in responding to issues, and has made my experience very much improved lately.",5,Madawi Balushi
294,"It's priced too high, like all apartments in Davis. The apartments are small and old, they don't have central heat or air conditioning. The manager is nice, however it is standard operating procedure at this place to tell new tenants that their security deposits are partially non-refundable for cleaning costs, which is DEFINITELY against state law. It's across the street from a nice park and centrally located, but other than that, it doesn't have a whole lot going on for it.",3,Tamara Miller
294,This apartment complex is disgusting.  The man in charge of leasing is a slob.  The majority of the complex smells like cat urine and people have garbage piled up on their patios.,1,Jason Blake

294,"I’ve lived here for three years, and overall, my experience has been great! Although it’s an older property, it’s well-maintained, and both management and maintenance are very responsive. The property manager, Tom, is fair and always quick to address any issues that come up.

However, my favorite part has to be the location. The property is in a quiet area, yet it’s very central—Trader Joe’s is within walking distance, campus is only five minutes away, and there are bus lines right in front of the property.

Overall would recommend!",5,Irvin Hernandez
295,"the new management team is taking things very seriously. the apartment complex has been upgraded in many ways. buildings are well kept and maintained, laundry facilities are app controlled without needing coins. the pool, gym and tennis court are all excellent. most importantly, neighbors are polite and friendly.

295,"Do Not Rent here, you will be miserable within a year. And probably sick. Slumlords, 100%. Paint over mold and retaliate for small service requests. Raise rent the full 10% allowed by law minus a few bucks, for strategic sake.

295,"Cockroaches when I moved in... took me ~2 months to mostly get rid of them.
Davis is expensive... try to find something else nevertheless

Edit after moving out:
I left the unit in a very clean condition, the walls were in the same shape as when I moved in.... However, instead of returning the security deposit, they even want to charge me extra by cleaning again (definitely not needed) and painting the walls.

Instead of being a bad place to live, my feeling now is that the management is quite shady!
Can't give 0 stars...",1,Nicolaus kratochwil
295,"EDIT: we have been here since 2021 and at first the management was HORRIBLE and would do nothing but now that Jon Berkley has taken over it has been SO much better! They fixed the exterior of the buildings and are repairing the laundry facilities after getting multiple complaints. They really try their best to help the residents and I appreciate it so much. The actual apartments are old, so they arent the best. But the management is great now!!!

this apartment complex genuinely sucks. first of all, the washer and dryers have been broken for months and they have done nothing to repair them. second, the heater in my apartment doesnt work, the garbage disposer doesnt work, and there is a cockroach problem despite me being very clean! not to mention, when i moved in, the apartment wasnt even clean and they said they would take some money off our next rent and then when my dad brought it up, it never happened! literally so unprofessional and they do nothing to fix any problems. so entirely overpriced for what you get considering how worn out the apartments are, the amenities suck, and it’s just generally dirty. would love if they actually updated the washer/dryer rooms, maybe did some nice landscaping or SOMETHING to make this place even remotely nice. I also think its funny because they just posted all of these flyers to refer people and get money for it but never for ANY amount of money,  would i refer anyone that i even remotely like or care about to live here.",4,Veronica M.
295,"The apartments are cheaply made, old, not well kept, expensive and getting more expensive without any upgrades. They are squeezing every last drop out of their tenants who get poor maintenance, pest issues, car break ins, and broken water pipes at least once a month. If you can afford anything else, do not get stuck at this place! Management has changed constantly and we are having to re-sign leases if we want to prevent a major rent hike (1950 from 1750 or 1800 if agreeing to lease). They will show you a better apartment than you move into. I was shown a completely renovated apartment and given one with extremely old appliances, wood and counter damage, and peeling baseboards perfect for the roaches to hide under! From what I've seen around the area, any other complex is better maintained! I ended up here because I was moving from out of town for a school and was convinced the apartments would be the condition of what I was shown. Once your lease is signed and your away from your support network, your stuck in their dingy little apartments. Absolute last resort!!",1,Breana Juelch

296,"They are crooks that prey on college students.   Yes, your stay there will be nice, but beware of when you move out.  They will try to charge you for things that aren’t needed and they will refuse to show you proof of damages.   It’s so bad and disrespectful to treat college students like this.  They are young and learning the ways of the world.  So if you want to teach your kids what NOT to do and how to treat people poorly, then let them stay here.   Crooks all around.
If you do choose to stay here, take photos of EVERYTHING before you move in.  Walls, ceilings, floors, cabinets, kitchen, everything you can think of.  Demand a walkthrough with them before you move in.   When you move out, demand a walkthrough with them again and make sure you bring your photos or they will deny everything.  The lease is a joke.  They say “reasonable wear and tear” but it’s so arbitrary that they will force you to pay to repaint the whole apartment, even if you don’t leave any holes or marks on the wall.   It’s not our responsibility to pay for the routine maintenance for the next tenant.  That’s part of the property owner’s cost of doing business.
Just BEWARE of hidden fees and BS charges when you move out.  They are crooks!",1,Tom

298,"I have lived here comfortably and enjoyed my time in this place. Mr. Tom always responded quickly to maintenance requests and resolved issues cooperatively. Above all, it was a safe residence. I was particularly satisfied with how well the garden, trees, and overall environment were maintained. The location was excellent, not only being near the greenbelt but also close to a community park, library, and schools, which made it a happy place for our children as well.",5,H. -Angella
298,"We lived at Alvarado Parkside for almost 4 years. We loved the location--close to the Davis green belt and grocery stores and just a few minutes drive from downtown and the UCD campus. The onsite managers, Izzy and then Jessica, were great. Good communication, very responsive, respectful, and pleasant to work with. Maintenance team was also very responsive every time we needed something addressed.

Ultimately, we decided to move out due to the following factors that you may want to consider before moving here:

- The buildings are dated, not insulated, and the windows have not been updated. As a result, there was very little insulation and drastic temperature swings between summer and winter. The AC and heating had trouble keeping the place comfortable, and our electricity bill in summer and winter would average almost $250/month, even while we were trying to conserve our use AC/heat use. In summer, we slept with ice packs on our bodies to stay cool and try to sleep.  The landlord doesn’t allow space heaters. We heard from multiple other tenants that their electricity bill exceeded $400/month at times. This was the primary reason we decided to move out into a newer and more modern place, which, after all costs accounted for, is costing us less per month to rent.

-The landlord’s (Tom) communication skills could be improved. Requests to the community through emails came off as threats rather than respectful requests. We’ve also come across Tom yelling at his maintenance personnel and property manager on multiple occasions. I recommend reading some more recent reviews on Yelp.

-Make sure to do a walk-through inspection before you move out if you want any part of your security deposit back. Heard from others that they got $5 of their deposit back after they deep cleaned their unit and followed all check-out procedures before moving out, so we made sure to schedule a walk-through and came to an agreement of how much of our security deposit we would get back.

-The free wifi through Instaconnect was pretty spotty. We got our own wifi.

-Hot water was spotty. Water for showering was lukewarm from around 11am – 5 pm each day.

-The bathrooms had little ventilation (no window, vent fan was weak), so the ceiling was prone to mold and mildew. We got a dehumidifier to help keep the bathroom dry.

-We could hear traffic and sirens on Covell every day. Wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a quiet place.

Overall, we would not recommend Alvarado Parkside.",2,Sophia C
298,"I have been here for a few months and have been impressed so far!

Pros:

Onsite management has been very responsive and helpful, thank you, Jessica! Star Crossed Properties and Tom were straightforward to work out a lease contract with. The process felt transparent and honest compared to other management companies I've considered in Davis. Management overall feels more respectful than other places I've rented from in Davis.

Noticed this property has been well cared for compared to nearby options with similarly aged buildings. Quick to respond to maintenance requests. Laundry room is clean and affordable compared to other properties in Davis.

Extra amenities such as the garden plots, communal park areas, and pool are lovely to have and well maintained.

Cons:

Price is high, but that really applies to all of Davis. I cannot deny the quality of management here, and that it's cost is in line with other options in Davis but provides a better experience than other options.

The onsite Wi-Fi provided by ""Instaconnect"" has been spotty and unresponsive to customer service requests, but this is not Star Crossed Properties fault. The responsibility falls mostly on Instaconnect to maintain their infrastructure better.

Summary:

I love Alvarado Parkside Apartments, so far it's been a great experience overall! I may update this review in the future as my Tenancy continues here. Looking forward to the rest of the year!",5,Mikayla Miller
298,"I have lived here more than a year and I think Alvarado Parkside is a great place to live in Davis.
It is quiet and the site manager and the management team are very responsive and helpful whenever I ask for help.

299,"Lived here for almost two years, although just at the move in my disposal was broken two times in a week and there are multiple times the pipe was jammed, huge shout out to the wonderful maintenance team who always respond so quickly. Them plus the floor plan were the reason we stayed so long here. And at this point I would like many other reviewers here and give a 5-star as well.

However, we were really disappointed at the move-out experience!!! Be ready that at move-out they would be very picky at every corner and hidden places that you would not even think of, so be sure to check every possible place before move-out or you might lost greater part of your deposits. Also they offered us a early moveout option which we thought kind of nice at first place, but it turns out that I’m paying the same rent with an apartment that I cannot use in any way because no one would take a summer lease. Just make sure that they have someone to take the room before signing the form.",1,Zhuoheng Li
299,"Beautiful Apartment complex (2021-2022), rented a 3 bed 2 bath apartment and loved living here. Rent is about in the average (maybe 100-200 bucks more) but that reflects in the quality, space and comfort. The management is very responsive and quick to resolve maintenance request.

303,"Five stars for the maintenance guys, always quick to respond to requests and get the job done. Negative three stars for the management. They do not stay on track with issues on leases and the communications between themselves are lacking.

I lived here for two years and went through a couple times when there’s a change in who lives in the household. They took almost a year to remove the people who no longer lived in the house and we ended up having five names when only three of us actually lived there. They charge utilities by the number of people in each house and we were just paying extra month by month. We had to sign new leases over and over again because their staff take forever to respond and doesn’t remember why we sign the new lease in the first place.

I also heard lots of bad comments on them charging unreasonable amount of deposits after people moved out. I didn’t go through the process because I transferred the lease to someone else, but when I moved in, the walls have holes, the carpets weren’t clean, and the appliances like the range hood was not clean.

If you do live here, you better hope you don’t have to deal with the management.",2,Harry Liu
303,"We first paid a $1200 deposit at the price of $4400 last year and confirmed the room type 4B3B. The Office staff at the time told us that our room type would be renovated. Then, two months later, the Office informed us that the price would be raised to $4800, because we confirmed at that time that the apartment type would not be renovated. Units that do not undergo renovation are all renewed and will not be offered to new resident. And when they first signed the contract, they advertised that our housing type would be renovated. So they actually just think that the price increase is not enough and find an excuse to cheat us. The employee was very good when the contract was signed at the beginning, but the manager who informed us later had a very bad attitude. Don't believe what their officer says, because they often lie",1,Zirui Zeng
303,"Throughout my 3 years of living here, I have never experienced more issues than after Sorrento switched their management in July 2022. I would *strongly* advise against living here for multiple reasons, most of which stem from the incompetent management and lack of concern for tenants.

The management is not transparent with any of the changes made to our lease. Our utility bills were paused for over 6 months with no communication up until yesterday, when an expensive bill was tacked onto our regular rent the day before it was due. We have also experienced multiple issues where Sorrento charged us the incorrect amount without approval or prior communication, resulting in a credit card discrepancy on my personal account. Management claimed they were unable to refund us the wrongly taken money. Instead, the incorrect charge is returned to us through credit for the next month's rent. This should not be taken lightly as many college students struggle to pay rent and cannot afford the impact of this mistake.

The leasing office is extremely understaffed, which is confusing because it seems like Sorrento puts funds towards almost every department (construction, repainting, advertising) EXCEPT for the customer service/management staff that they desperately need. Often times, it takes 5+ phone calls to speak to someone about a small issue, let alone something urgent like a power outage. If you try to get in-person assistance, the front desk lady is never on time, sometimes several hours late to open up the leasing office. Management shows little sympathy and true concern for the needs of their tenants.

Regarding their facilities, everything is just ""okay"". Laundry room often has broken machines, our kitchen fridge and dishwasher were partially broken when we moved in, and nothing was cleaned as promised. Definitely not worth any of the hassle that we have endured.

Overall, we have had a disappointing experience to close out our last year living at Sorrento. To future students and residents, we advise you to look elsewhere for housing.",1,Kristen Tsai
303,"I have lived year for 3 years and I can assure everyone the bad reviews do not apply anymore as Sorrento has changed their management and they are now under FPI management and absolutely amazing.

304,"Identity Davis has been one of the most disappointing leasing experiences I’ve ever had. From broken elevators to lack of transparency with pricing, the list of issues is endless. Their customer service is abysmal. Instead of resolving problems, they resort to making threats. They even lost one of my packages and refused to take responsibility, despite sending me multiple emails confirming they had it. I deeply regret signing a lease here. The poor management, lack of accountability, and overall disregard for residents make this a terrible place to live. I would not recommend Identity Davis to anyone.

306,"Our experience here was TERRIBLE.
Pietro was supposed to live at Seville for six months (wich he paid in advance) but was basically forced to leave the place since the situation with Maria was crazy. The house was a complete mess and smelled like dog feces, the dogs would pee and poo inside the house on the carpet. Pietro was supposed to take care of one dog but ended up living with three and Maria sleeping in the common area of the house (when she wasn’t supposed to live there). He left in July instead of October 2024 and to this day we still didn’t get the money back. Maria keeps making up excuses.
We talked to Vicky and the people at the reception about the situation and they didn’t help in any way. They are well aware of what Maria does, and still allow it. CRAZY. Our only choice is a lawyer. Luckily we still have all the emails and conversations as proof. She already gave the money back to other people that were living with Pietro but keeps making up excuses to him. If Vicky or the people working here can do anything about this, we’ll be very happy, otherwise we’ll proceed with legal actions. We waited too much already.",1,Franca Rojo

Jesicca was great she held our apt for us longer than she could have  though we had a difficult time acquiring the rather high deposit which was little higher than we exspected do to our ""laps in rental histery"" She got us in Jessica is easy to work with.
As in any UC Davis or any college town apt complex there will be noizy students from what we have exsperinced here the noize level  has been minimal.althogh we have not yet experianced  finals lol.We have met several of our neighbor so far  great people very diverse.
As far as maintenance goes every time we have called them after hours they were very promt to address and fix the issue, Walter the onsite maintenance guy was on it every time in just minutes.
Davinci is one of thr cleanest apts I'v been at in Davis ""inside and out"" no sign's of flys or bugs of any sort. pool and spa is clean and in great working order.
The parking is diffult at times but you have to realise that with many four bedroom rentals there could be as many as four cars per unit,Its it's just how it is. They do offer reserved parking for a reasonable fee ,on the otherhand i'v lived at a apt just down the street that was quick to have a vehicle towed if parked in wrong spot or forgeting to put parking pass in window and as a resident this resulted in my car being towed twice and one of my visitors towed ,""no thank you""  Over all it is a great place to live and seems s like Jessica is dedicated to making improvements and upgrades to Davinci A great place to call home

308,"I lived here for a year, ended my lease because i found a better place to live. Very expensive for the quality of the townhome. Not worth it. You can find nicer for cheaper or same price.  The fence in the back needs updating, the sliding door I had was in horrible condition after i was told it was going to be fixed. I moved in and things were not updated as they were supposed to be.. another huge issue with this place is it has BAD roaches. My family and I were constantly sick living here, I don't know for sure but I am assuming it was from the roaches. Which I read can cause ppl to be sick.. when I moved in Alan was the manager, he was ok. Never had any issues with him besides his slow response to emails and service requests. However, all of a sudden he disappeared. No information to the tenants as to what happened. After that we did not have any consistent manager. Madison took over part time. She was fine, never had any issues with her, she answered my emails in a timely manner. I would not recommend this property due to the roaches, the price/quality of Townhome, and the management issue. I feel that you can get your money worth else where in Davis. The only positive thing is that it's a quiet complex, but most of Davis is quiet. However homeless do go through dumpsters and there is no maintenance person that I ever seen.",1,Bri Symone
308,"Management is extremely slow and has poor communication when it comes to responding to maintenance/emergencies. The office is rarely open, it’s impossible to get ahold of anyone on the phone, and the emergency maintenance number on the office voicemail goes to a wrong number. After dealing with this once when our AC broken I complained to someone enough that they changed the voicemail…to a different wrong number for somebody who works at a different complex. We’ve had our AC break twice and a sewage backup from a root growing into the line and every time there is an issue it’s like pulling teeth trying to get any timely or reliable information from the management. Most of the time I have to call the regional manager to then get them to contact the Westwood people. Service appointments given by management are routinely missed and I have to call back several times. Plan on having to stay in a hotel several times a year if something vital breaks and management is slow to respond. Highly recommend looking anywhere else for housing.",1,Vincent Powell
308,"Experience purely as somebody applying for lease:
(Alan Valencia) is extremely unreliable. Multiple times now myself and prospective cosigners have reached out asking for important documents such as the welcome letter, or lease agreement. Each time, we were told that he'd get back to us within a week or two, and each time was a lie. After an utter failure on the behalf of the property manager, I reached out to the regional manager. My first couple of attempts made to reach out to the RM were as futile as the PM. After a bit of a gap and another attempt, the welcome letter was given to us. By this point, we'd paid 250 dollars total, and whatever the legal maximum cost for a background check in California is. Following the first necessary document signing,  myself and a cosigner met with the man so we could discuss move-in and the lease proper. We were promised our full lease within a week or so of emailing him when we'd be available to move-in. On my part, I took about a week to tell him when we'd be available to move-in. The next day I was told we'd be sent the lease agreement by the end of the working week at the latest. A couple days after, it was next week. 12 or so days later, I email him asking for an update on that lease agreement. Nothing. Its been over a month now since I was promise the lease agreement. Nothing.

The management here is an utter mess if none of the other comments here have made it clear already. Not only the property management, but the regional management as well, if only for allowing this menagerie of chaos and cruelty to occur. The manager here and the those above him are making people's accessibility to housing difficult for no good reason I'm sure, and harming plenty in the process. Do not even apply for this place--or any other FPI Management property for that manner--you might as well throw 250 and more out the window and wish it a good day. It will at least make some lucky passer-bys' day, unlike anything associated with this mess.",1,Rivers Stout

There are a lot good and cheap apartment around Davis. This is not one of them.",1,Xizhou “Neal” Zhu
309,"These apartments are located very conveniently to the college campus.  Access to other important things like grocery stores are also available nearby.  The rent is on the lower side of most apartments around, but so is the general maintenance of the facility.  You can easily say it's a ""little"" run down and from what I've witnessed, it doesn't get much attention from the management/ownership either.  There are no elevators, so if you are moving into the top third story apartments, you'll get plenty of exercise.  Parking is cramped and it has a low ceiling as part of the open garage, so if you drive a truck or a full sized car, good luck with that.  Overall it appears to be safe, but by looking at it, you might question if that's truly the case.  Bikes have been known to be stolen from here, so pay attention.",3,Greg Roderick
309,"The only good thing is the proximity to UMall and campus. Brenda was a terrible manager who would not help us fix broken utilities and only cleaned up the pool when her family came over. Otherwise the pool would look green and be full of sticks and even got a health code violation. The study room? Filled with mattresses the whole year I was there. Laundry room? Broken. I cleaned up everything before I left and never got my security deposit back. If you have a choice to lease elsewhere, do it.",2,Eva

This is coming from someone who was looking for any place to stay that was under $400 a month, which is why I'm mainly happy with my apartment. It depends on your opinion, however, if you're looking for a decent place that's near college city life, this is a good place to live. Additionally, it is true that this complex is old and some things can be broken or ""run down"", BUT if you tell the manager, it will be fixed. No problems with me on that. And depending on who you live with, and how accustomed you are to apartment life in general, this place is clean. And older building, yes, but good for living, honest opinion.",5,Elisabeth Mcgowan
309,Great location. The apartments are a bit run down looking but everything works fine and the price is good for being right next to campus. Never had any trouble with management.

It comes furnished and the couches they provide are awesome.,4,Hannah Craig

310,"Parents and students… BE WARNED!  Stay away from UNIVERSITY COURT; 515 Sycamore LN in Davis CA.   The entire complex is infested with rats and unethical management practices.  The only good thing about University Court is the location (located next to Trader Joes and across the street from UC Davis).  We moved my son into his apartment at University Court  (UC) in SEP 2021 and were provided a lease agreement that guarantees liability/responsibility for the unpaid debts of the other lease holder/roommate who fails to pay their half of the rent on time.  It’s my fault for not reading the fine print… so please don’t make the same mistake I did.  During the period of 09/15/2021 through 08/30/2024, my son had three different roommates, who either left after transferring into another school, or dropped out due to poor grades. Each time we received aggressive and intimidating letters, emails and phone calls from University Court management telling us that we were responsible for the other roommate’s rent/liabilities regardless of our good standing for paying our half of the rent on time.  When we tried to discuss or dispute the situation with UC management… the only thing they would say is, “it’s in the lease and if you don’t pay the total amount we will simply send your account to a collection agency, ruin your credit and evict your student from the apartment”.  To add insult to injury… the entire apartment/complex is infested with HUGE RATS (we have the photos and the videos to prove it!).  After repeated complaints to UC management… their response was to send a maintenance person to the apartment and set two rat traps (which did absolutely nothing at all).  The rat infestation got so bad that my son had to move out two months early and find another room to rent so he could graduate on time.  When his lease was finally up we returned to the vacant apartment… and were horrified to see how the rats had eaten the furniture, carpet, baseboards, and parts of the doors and walls.  The apartment was filled with rat droppings and the smell of rodent urine.  Instead of moving my son’s furniture and belongings out of the apartment, we were forced to throw everything away due to the damage and infestation issues. We were afraid of disease and the possibility of spreading the rat infestation into his new apartment.  The situation even gets worse! After thoroughly cleaning the apartment and turning in the keys… UC management refused to inspect the apartment with us in order to view the damage and rat infestation. They told us they were sorry for the rat issues and they would refund our $700 security deposit once they did their own inspection 3 days later.  Not only did this corrupt UC management staff keep our $700 security deposit… but they charged us an additional $149.19 for painting, cleaning and damage caused by the hungry rats.  And yes… it was followed up with an additional threatening letter telling us to pay the bill or face the consequences of a collection agency that would ruin our credit score.  We are reporting University Court to the authorities and to the UC David Health commission in order to protect other UC Davis students from University Court’s unscrupulous management practices.  Please stay away from University Court… there are other apartments available in the immediate area without rats (this includes the rodents and the employees who work for University Court).",1,Ed

310,"Lived here for a year and a half and it was an absolutely great experience! The apartments are really clean and well-maintained. The management changed around end of last year and since then they have been fantastic! Art, the new manager, is very approachable and helpful and welcoming always. They were also very understanding about my ESA cat. The only cons were that the laundry room and garbage area was really far from my unit and especially since I was on the third floor but the elevator helps. Also my unit was above the gate so I would hear it slam a lot and since it’s a big complex you hear people come and go but it’s not too bad at all. Another thing was that the kitchen was too cramped for my liking with no dishwasher and the AC is only in the living room but buying a fan solved that for the most part for me. Overall really great experience! Great amenities, quick maintenance, clean,  well-maintained environment and just a really great community! The clubhouse has a billiards table and seating areas where I’d hang out with friends and the complex did resident events which were nice to go to. Would definitely recommend living here, I only moved out due to wanting a 1 bedroom instead of the 2 bedroom that I shared with a friend and theirs is out of my price range.",5,Madawi Balushi
311,"Apartment management and maintenance are the best! They are all friendly and responsive to emails/maintenance requests. I still remember how easy move-in day was because they were really accommodating when I needed to move-in a little earlier a couple years ago. A special thanks to Tiffany and Jose! The rent may be going up, but it is worth it for the excellent staff here.

The only downside I have is that parking can be tight, especially when you have a large or long car due to the oddly spaced concrete spacers. However, I think the the amenities, neat events, great staff, and comfortable apartments more than make up for the parking situation. If you are looking for a good place to live, I highly recommend this place.",5,Stephanie Tsai
311,"I would start off by saying that Maggie Tobin made it possible for me to navigate the decision to live at Chaparral Apartments. She was the best !!!! always available to answer questions and concerns, always pleasant, always courteous. She is a creative problem solver and supportive through out my stay at Chaparral apartments. I also witnessed Tiffany and Maggie being generously kind when the laundry room had a water issue. Thank you for all the prompt repairs too, I never experienced immediately repaired so fast, like refrigerator replaced, Jose was excellent with all the concerns and always pleasant and courteous.. And Lindsey is terrific, high positive energy which made my move out feel better despite the stress to clearing out stuff. I was in an unusual situation because I didn't known anyone in town and I felt the management  had my back. So I can't thank you enough. Sincerely, Lynda Silva",5,Lynda Silva
311,"Chaparral has the sweetest staff and maintenance team, and I highly recommend the apartment complex.  I leased my apartment with them beginning in 2020 and am so happy I picked them.

They also have fun giveaways and competitions that they do through their Instagram that are very fun. Happy to say I live at Chaparral!!",5,Sierra Reed
311,"Excellent responsive and friendly management, well maintained apartment and amenities. Don't feel like I'm getting price gouged, which is rare in Davis. Safeway is like a 5-10 minute walk away. Quiet and safe neighborhood.  Sad that I have to move from here!",5,Richa Nanavati

314,"I only sublet for the summer of 2019 but my experience has been dreadful. There were cockroaches periodically even though we did our best to keep the place clean. Even after the management brought pest control, I still noticed some very-much-alive cockroaches come out eventually (again, I only stayed around 2 months so the reappearance is more than a bit unacceptable).",1,Angela Tu

314,"Our stay at Almondwood was overall good. The management was friendly and helpful, and the facilities were nice. We especially liked the pool, hot tub, 24-hr study room, and printing room. Of course, the location is great with G/J bus lines and walking distance to safeway (open til 3AM).

We only had one issue: they overcharged us at the end of our lease (primarily, they charged for painting that wasn't planned/necessary). We emailed them and they apologized and gave us a full deposit refund. Their response to our email was quick and courteous, and they assured us that it was a mistake.

Overall, I would recommend staying at Almondwood. The location and price make sense for college student living.",4,Jack Goon

The on-site amenities like the pool, fitness center, and study lounges make daily life convenient and enjoyable. Plus, the community events they host create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.

Nugget is around the corner so she is able to walk down for groceries which is super convenient for her. The bus stop is nearby too which is great. Would reccommend,5,Maria Navarrete
316,"The Green is not perfect, but it’s not terrible either.

Pros: spacious apartments, extensive kitchen, almost everything is clean and new, and CAs host fun events on your floor sometimes! The mail system with the lockers is very easy and convenient. Sunsets are pretty here.

Cons: sometimes roaches and bugs get into the lobby, Wi-Fi is not the best, but if you don’t game often, you won’t have many issues. Laundry is expensive.

My roommate and I had a water leak in our router and it got fixed around a week later, as they were short staffed. The maintenance guys were kind, though.

It’s around a 12 minute bike ride or a 45 minute walk from my building to my first class of the day- for that reason, I’m unsure if I’ll live here next year. I’d prefer somewhere closer to Campus. For transfer housing though, it’s not a bad option, so I’d give it 3.5 stars.

Update: 1/17/23

More cons: The Green is susceptible to losing power (especially/specifically 184 Horizon. They’re on a different grid than all the other buildings for some reason.

Wi-Fi issues! As I’m writing this now I have no Wi-Fi and am unable to start my assignments.

If you want to park close to your building without tandem parking, and live in 298 Citron/Horizon good luck! There’s barely any unassigned parking near those buildings, and you’ll have to walk 0.2 miles just to get to your car. It’s over $600/year, by the way.

It’s not that close to campus compared to other apartment complexes.

My apartment had another water leak due to poor patching of the celling with little response from maintenance. They are very helpful when I could get ahold of them in the past, though, but I can’t say I enjoy scattering pots and pans around to catch the water.",3,Abby Reilly
316,"no hot water in my unit for weeks, despite multiple maintenance requests and claims the issue is “fixed.” laundry machines also either break down or don’t dry properly and force you to pay again (bonus: dryers used to cost $1.25 but were recently raised to $1.50)",1,Hannah Salas
316,"honestly living here was not horrible. most of the pros come from it being a new construction. i think my roomate and i were the first to live in our unit. i think the experience will go down with time as you can tell it was built very cheaply and quickly. it was very clean and nothing in our unit was broken except for maybe the ac as the common area would not get cold while our bedrooms would be freezing. the furniture was pretty uncomfortable but i wasn’t surprised considering this is student housing and they probably got the cheapest furniture available. the parking situation is kinda horrible and it is expensive considering your options. either have a tandem spot, or a single unassigned spot which could leave you a far walk from your building. the location is okay. you are a bit disconnected from the rest of davis, but the V line makes it very easy to get to campus quickly. your packages are secure w the luxer boxes. the worst thing about living here were the constant power and wifi outages which are definitely not normal. honestly i would live here again and i regret all of the complaining i did living here after i moved to a different horrible apartment in davis for my final year. it is not the most homey place but its fine for a college apartment.",3,maya martinez
316,I had a bit of a issue with the washer here at The green. I contacted the staff and sent them a email about what was going on. The assistant facilities director contacted me very quickly and apologize. He went out his way to make sure that the washers were clean and I was compensated. He made everything very smooth and easy. He was easy to talk to and made sure he was doing everything he could. I washed again this week and the washers were completely clean. He then assured me that he would be doing this process annually. He genuinely helped me and assured that the future this would be an issue!,5,lesly leyva
316,"I can’t say enough bad things about the green. First of all, the parking situation is RIDICULOUS. They leave empty space and dead fields next to the likely intentionally small lots and then charge upwards of $700 for parking, which is usually completely full anyways resulting in a nearly half mile walk to your apartment. Catalytic converter theft is rampant yet they do not care at all nor do they make any attempt to deter such thefts. They do not care about anything other than squeezing every penny from their tenants that they can. Tiny washing machines, terrible management, god awful communication, bad power, water, and internet among other things. My apartment has some outlets that aren’t even real, there is a layer of plastic behind them preventing them from being used. On top of that, there are switches in the bathroom that don’t even do anything? No fan in the bathroom either. The oven creates so much smoke and takes an eternity to preheat despite it being almost brand new. The cabinet space is awful especially under the sinks, where they put up a board in an attempt to make it look clean but instead just create a huge inconvenience for anyone trying to actually live there. The room selection process was also very bad, and information was given so late everyone was left scrambling. Plus only one Ethernet port for the entire apartment? Seriously? How can they be that out of touch to not realize that college students use Ethernet for more than just a TV? Paint on the walls is super cheap and will easily scrape right off if you bump it with your fingernail. My dorm has a nail that is FACING UPWARDS in the carpet! It’s poked me and my roommate many times before we realized what it was and covered it with some tape. I’ve heard there are also lots of thefts at the mail room although i have not experienced this, but it isn’t surprising at all. The only positive thing i have to say is the maintenance guys are super chill, and very responsive. Came to our apartment about an issue with the stove on the same day and were very helpful. Avoid the green at all costs, especially if you are planning on bringing a car.",1,John Goht
317,"Casitas was one of the few places in Davis that offered a short-term fall quarter lease, which I badly needed. Management was very responsive and courteous when I was signing up for a unit. The apartment also had plenty of nice amenities, like a pool and hot tub, laundry room (although they also rent out in-unit washers and dryers), and printing services. Personally I was glad to use the hot tub, since the one at my previous apartment was closed for a long time due to COVID. The actual unit itself was really nice, and maintenance was very quick to respond.

One minor complaint I do have is that I can hear people talking loudly at night outside sometimes, probably at the parking area. I guess that's outside the apartment's control. One of my roommates also noted that the freezer in our apartment wasn't cold enough to keep his ice cream frozen.

I also got my full deposit back (both the base and the pet deposit), which was a pleasant surprise.

Both the apartments I lived in at Davis happened to be managed by Tandem Properties, and I highly recommend getting a lease with them.",5,Aaron Ong
317,"Casitas is a great place to live all in all--maintenance was always quick, the leasing office was always kind and helpful, and the area is great. The units are kind of rundown, but it's nothing terrible. However, that being said, I wouldn't recommend living here less than one year, as they may take a lot out of your security deposit because the lease states that they can. We cleaned our unit well and trust me when I say there was no need for more paint on the walls, but we still got charged for cleaning and painting. So, in the end, a good place to live if you're looking for somewhere longer than a year.",4,alex w
317,"I've lived at several apartments throughout my time in Davis, but Casitas Apartments comes out on top in virtually every aspect. The location is conveniently located close to several Unitrans bus lines and Anderson Plaza, so it is no problem to get around town.

The rent is very reasonable considering the quality of the apartment and location, so I would definitely recommend this place to anybody else looking for housing!",5,Runire

Although rental costs are high in this part of North Davis, what keeps me here are the great variety of floor plans to choose from, amenities, and excellent management.  Specifically:
1. Private covered parking for duplexes
2. Large yards and living spaces
3. Ceiling fans
4. Indoor washer/dryer hookups
5. Updated appliances
6. Management are prompt to respond to questions.
7. Maintenance is both friendly and resolves issues quickly, including emergency service after hours and on weekend for things like water heater leaks and A/C failure.

319,"This is Stephanie Singelyn AGAIN! I'm using my husband's account, but my previous post is in the reviews. My last review stated how fraudulent the property management company of Temescle is. The management promptly responded to my post and said the boys were to get their full security deposit back as well as the ""so called"" damages money which there was none. Temescle sent  the boys to collections as a scare tactic and forced them to pay over 600 dollars in damage which there was again,  was none.  This all happened in September/October. We are now in February and after many calls by the boys, nobody AGAIN will return a call and they have yet to receive the money owed to them. This place is a scam in every way possible.

319,"Renters Beware! This place is a scam for many reasons and i would NEVER let my college student rent here!!!!!!!The office staff is the most unprofessional rude people I have ever dealt with. When submitting repair requests, they don't take care of their responsibilities. They will ask you if you want to move out before your lease is up, and offer you a discount on your cleaning fee, but they will turn around and assess damages that you ""supposedly"" created, even though they do quarterly checks on your apartment to let you know something needs to be fixed. Upon your exit from your apartment, they will come in and do their cleaning and painting and then tell you that there was damage and they know they can get away with it even though they were there less than a year. They send you to collections without telling the tennants what damages they are being charged for. This company is disgusting, but what makes this company disgusting, once again,  is their employees (office staff) . Don't waste your money at this place. They are criminals!",1,Stephanie Singelyn

They will send you a violation for the smallest things, holiday decor being out a day too long, random things on your tiny porch. I have lived here for six months and Nicole has made my time here MISERABLE with the amount of screw ups on their end!
The apartments are poorly maintained and overpriced. The counters are flaking away and they just put a new coat of paint on them. The pool, gym, and amenities are never open, and if they are they're disgusting and full of rotting leaves, trash that never gets picked up. The only good thing about this complex is the location!",1,Konoba

Nicole is always welcoming when I come in to talk to her about any issues and she’s willing to work with you. People leaving reviews about the gym, pool, and amenities not being open was because they were under renewal which is reasonable. Now, they’re open for anyone to use and I have had no problem with them.

One of the bigger issues being the house was in horrible condition when we rented it out starting in the summer. AC not working and cooling the house. Management changed in the middle of our lease, which was horrible because after we moved out, had to pay costs for the horrible quality apartment. Basically, they used our money to repair the apartment after we had moved out, instead of during our time there. Maintenance requests are slow and never go into full effect.",1,Starym Drake

They will keep you waiting for almost a month, asking endless questions and using a poorly managed AI software called SNAPPT. This software forces you to submit documents in the most inefficient and infuriating way possible, even after they confirmed that financial aid and scholarships were acceptable before applying. They simply can't handle these types of documents with the experimental AI software tools they currently use.

323,I normally don’t do this but I wanted to give recognition where it is deserved. I have been calling around different properties in the Davis area and why is it so hard for apartments to answer the phone? When someone did answer it seemed like I was inconveniencing them… where has customer service gone? That was until I called Pinecrest Apartments and spoke with Azu (I apologize if I misspelled this)! She was absolutely delightful on the phone! She took the time to answer all of my questions and was great about trying to get me in there without being over pushy. Even though they didn’t have what I was looking for I felt it necessary to give a kudos to Azu for the great display of customer service. It seems to be a lost art form in the property management world.  I will be referring people here not because of the property or prices but because of the level of customer service they deliver. Thank you again Azu!,5,Danny
323,We moved into these apartment around last year and it honestly wasn’t that bad to start. They fixed the coin only laundry machines after it ate around 25$ in quarters. We also had put in a work order and selected the do not enter if we arnt home option yet the maintenance guy still unlocked the door and came in. The sprinklers are also all broken and spray you as you walk to your house anytime after 8 pm and continues all the way until 12 midnight. There was a small rat problem when we left mainly just dying and being left near our stairs so we’d have to throw them out. Our lights in the apartment also flicker a lot and can’t really be screwed back on because it’s a digital led light. Lastly but most importantly the last 2-3 months the water keept getting shut off with little or sometimes no notice and when it turned back on it would be muddy and or still without heat or low pressure. All in all I’d give the apartment a 2 star if it wasnt for the inconvenient water issues for months but I do have to say the staff was friendly and attentive. Still wouldn’t recommended to anyone hope this helps anyone considering moving here.,1,Lori Jennings

This might sound a bit over the top and that may be but this was home to me. From the front office staff like Natalie and Kaylin to the maintenance staff like Tim and Alex everybody was incredibly hard working and kind. They bent over backwards to do everything they could to make our lives easier here. The only reason why I moved was because I was no longer a student and no longer allowed to live there. I would have continued if I was given the choice. Do yourself a favor and live here if you can. You will not regret it.",5,Dylan Hunt

Appreciate your time Sasha, and I am looking forward to moving in at Axis very soon!!",5,Alexander Goodman
327,"I had a amazing experience working with Ricky at Axis ! As a first-time renter, I was a bit nervous about the lease process, but Ricky made everything incredibly smooth and straightforward. He was patient, attentive, and answered all my questions, ensuring I felt confident every step of the way. I truly appreciate his help and professionalism throughout the entire process. Highly recommend Ricky and the Axis at Davis for help!",5,Josiah Harris
327,"A friend of mine was looking at this place and suggested I should take a look. Romeo was super helpful! They had floor plans and mock-ups of the kitchen areas and living space in their temporary office downtown. We were also able to see renderings of the amenities! Romeo helped me get the lease signed on the same day and said on-site tours will be available soon! He was very informative (not just about Axis, but his experience working at other properties too) and was super friendly. If you’re looking for housing in Davis and Axis is within your budget, I would highly recommend checking this place out.",5,Tim Pham
328,"Reasonable housing. Maintenance is fast and amazing. Quiet place. However, parking is horrible during the week. It is hard to find a spot after about 9-10 PM. If you get home later in the day, even with a registered parking permit, you will find yourself parking on the street. Parking regulations could definitely improve.",3,xitlaly espinoza

330,"I stayed here for over 2 years, and every single day I loved this place. Some perks of staying here:
- Great management
- Awesome amenities
- Close to grocery stores (Safeway, Savemart), CVS, Big5 sporting goods, and many restaurants
- Easy access to G and J lines",5,Rohith Raj
330,"Installed bluetooth doorknobs that are incredibly inconvenient. Pool is never clean. ""Weight room"" is just a bike and like 3 sets of dumbells. Parking is overpriced and tow trucks come through often. Unhelpful staff when my motorcycle got stolen from the lot.",2,Jordan Hekker
330,"great place to live if you are ok with cockroaches crawling up your leg at 1 am in the bathroom (yes this really happened to me). poor pest control, severe ant and cockroach problem, service will just come in and spray the walls and leave which does nothing instead of fixing the actual problem.  walls are incredibly thin and you will find people partying in the pool area until 3 or 4 am. luckily i am moving out in two weeks, do your research before moving here, i wish i had.",2,Sarah Thomas
330,"I lived at La Salle for two years, and I cannot recommend this apartment complex. There was turnover of management in my time there, and it genuinely felt like they cared little for the residents, and only about taking as much money from us as possible. While the location was nice, the apartment and amenities did not seem worth it for the price. During my time there, parking costs increased significantly (it went from one free spot allotted to a 1 bdr/1bth, to costing $300+ per year!). The parking lot was huge and never full, and their justifications for this increase simply did not make sense. They claimed it was so passes could be offered for shorter time periods to ""help"" residents, yet the new ""minimum"" parking pass period was 6 months, and the cost of the shorter parking pass time period quickly exceeded the cost of a full year pass. Basically, they made it not even worth it to get a shorter parking pass, all while significantly increasing the cost of parking overall. Parties and noise were quite consistent, so I would avoid this place if you're looking for somewhere quiet. I once locked myself out of my apartment (it was a freak accident, my sliding door lock fell back into place), and upon calling maintenance, I was told that it wasn't their problem because they wouldn't get paid to help, and to figure it out myself, forcing me to call a locksmith. While this was my fault, it certainly showed that they will not go above and beyond to help their residents. Management was inconsistent with their construction notifications--in fact, they once provided less than 45 minutes notice that cars needed to be moved for parking lot construction the following day, before they began towing cars! Before move out, we were provided a clear list of things to clean before move out, which my partner and I strictly followed (we even cleaned more than we were asked to). We were then told by the manager to not worry about cleaning during their inspection of our apartment because ""most residents don't clean what they need to anyways."" They told us that the complex had to hire professional cleaners due to COVID, and made us foot the bill for their required protocols. When we told the manager that we were thoroughly cleaning the place as outlined on the move-out form, they told us to not bother, and they took out a significant chunk of our deposit anyway. While I initially enjoyed living at La Salle, I highly suggest to look elsewhere.",2,Anna
330,"To be fair, it's probably not the worst place to live in Davis. However, by the end of my lease, my roommates and I began to realize we were being scammed. Despite begging us to accomodate new customers by moving out earlier than our lease initially stated (an increasingly complex task amidst covid conditions) and promising us part of our last month's rent back, La salle ended up refusing to return out rent because their agreement with the next tenants fell thru. Additionally, despite advising us on what to clean and providing an ""itemized list,"" nearly our entire deposit was withheld. While neither of these things may be illegal (im not sure), it certainly isnt the kind of business I'd like to associate with again. My advice is to make peace with being scammed or find a new complex",1,Mia K.
331,"I have lived in Davis since 2019 and this place has by far provided the best housing experience. The maintenance team is amazing and respond very quickly. Management also has been very helpful throughout our time here and are very nice. The option to add the Stonegate country club is also a great perk, especially if you want to use their gym instead of the ARC. Only downside is there is no option to break the lease other than a lease transfer.",5,Ramses Denis-Romero
331,The gym and pool area are great and maintenance has always been timely when requested. The new smart locks are also nice.,4,Anna Ayers
331,"We have lived here for 3 years with our two large dogs and never had a problem. The complex itself looks older on the outside but they've done some renovations on the inside where most units are wood instead of carpet (besides the bedrooms). I've had no complaints with our units and maintenance is always quick to respond to requests (usually come the day of or the next day). The washer and dryers are relatively new and were usually working just fine. The community director, Lexi, is newer but has been such a great addition to the team and has been nothing short of amazing. She's always really responsive and once even helped us bring a package inside our apartment while we were on vacation, she made our moving out process really easy. I also want to say that the maintenance team especially, Sal, is really on top of it. I also love that the complex will host community gathers and events where they will provide food, drinks, snacks, etc. I hope they continue to do this throughout the year. If we were to ever find ourselves back in the area, we would without a doubt rent here again!",4,Juliet Chu
331,"We have lived here for two years and love it! It’s still pretty close to campus with a nice bike path that goes right to campus or just a quick drive. But it’s so lovely and quiet here, no noisy freeway, nice walking paths around and a park right behind. The apartments are pretty spacious and nice! The maintenance team is really quick to get to any issues when you submit a work order. The management is amazing and sets up fun events for the complex, and are just great if you have any issues. There’s a great community area and a fantastic gym. I highly recommend living here!",5,Lana Smith
331,"I recently had the pleasure of living at these apartments, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of exceptional. The amenities were top-notch, and the community atmosphere was fantastic.
Firstly, I absolutely loved the gym and pool on the property. They were well-maintained and provided a great opportunity to stay active and relax. Additionally, the area to grill was perfect for hosting barbecues and enjoying the beautiful weather.
The apartments themselves were also quite impressive. They had been recently updated with nice features like smart thermostats, which made living there both comfortable and convenient. I also appreciated the location, which was close to West Manor Park and provided easy access to activities like tennis and basketball.
The maintenance team was friendly and quick to respond to any requests I had, and the staff overall was fantastic. They even offered fun movie nights and holiday-themed events, which made the community feel like a real home.
Overall, I highly recommend these apartments to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable living experience.",5,Selena Gonzalez

The apartments are fully furnished with modern appliances, in-unit laundry, and private bathrooms, which makes things easy. Management is very responsive, and the location works well for students and professionals. Overall, it’s a well-designed space that makes daily life comfortable. Highly recommended to anyone looking to rent.",5,Rj Berumen
334,"Wonderful apartment complex with everything you could possibly hope for amenity-wise (pool, grills, outdoor courtyard, game rooms, arcade).

Nice bike garages and proximity to campus make it a great place to bike from. Furnishing in rooms is nice and there are a variety of layouts to choose from. On top of everything, the building managers are incredibly caring and put in tons of work to make sure every resident is getting the most out of their experience.",5,Justin Lemmon
334,"I've lived at Ryder for 2 years and I absolutely love it. The property is kept clean, the location is right next to downtown Davis and is within walking and biking distance to campus, and the front desk staff are always lovely and extremely helpful. I also love being able to have my own private room without having to worry about organizing 3-5 other people to sign a lease for a whole apartment.",5,Alejandro Brent
334,"If you’re looking for an affordable place to live in Davis, Ryder is it! Ryder has an affordable housing program that includes all amenities AND you don’t have to pay for utilities (it’s covered). I’ve lived at two other apartment complex’s here in Davis and none of them compare to Ryder. Ryder has one of the biggest apartment gyms, multiple study rooms with free printing, a social lounge, karaoke room, fully furnished units, in unit washer & dryer, and it’s very close to campus. As a college student who has been living here the past 2 years I love it!",5,Heidy Cortez

335,"Lived here 2021-2022, and visited many times over the years. Lexington is a nice, clean, and modern complex with some cool amenities. The front office staff was very nice and helpful, and many of the residents were friends with them. The units are spacious and comfortable but the kitchen is really undersized for 3+ people.

The location is convenient for accessing the freeway, downtown, and campus. The Richards-Olive intersection gets terribly congested and it's annoying having to go through it every time you enter/exit Olive Drive. There's also a liquor store and In-N-Out nearby and the air often smells like fries.

My biggest complaints would be the noise and the strange people roaming Olive Drive. Having a liquor store next to an apartment full of undergrads means parties happen often (I should know, I partied here many times even before I was a resident). And since the pandemic, a bunch of homeless people started hanging around outside begging for money, passing out next to buildings, peeing on the sidewalk, or walking down the street at night screaming at the top of their lungs.

I lived in Davis for over a decade and Lexington was one of my favorite apartments as far as the units themselves and the staff. But unfortunately, factors beyond management's control prevent this place from being perfect.",4,Mr Evil Guy
335,"My experience living here started off pretty great for the first six months, but things took a turn when management changed. The apartments themselves are decent and you get what you pay for, but dealing with the leasing office has been a headache. They pretty much tune you out. Despite having quiet hours, noise has been an issue, and when I brought it up to the office, they brushed it off and suggested I reflect on my own actions instead – talk about unhelpful! Also, the number for reporting noise might as well be for show because it does nothing. And there's this new person at the front desk, blonde, who could seriously work on her attitude. It's been a frustrating  to say the least.",2,Micky Moniak
335,"The Lexington apartments were amazing to live in for my first college apartment. The staff are all so friendly, kind, helpful, and overall really fantastic. Kazia, the property manager, really made my experience a great one. She is so helpful and goes out of her way to make everyone feel listened to, cared for, and safe. The apartments are all clean and well taken care of and maintenance is timely and efficient. I will miss this apartment complex very much and everyone who made it such a wonderful experience.",5,Catherine Dark
335,"I enjoyed living here!! I lived at the Lexington Apartments for 2-years (transfer student). My two years here have been enjoyable. I have never had an issue, and Kazia and her team are always ready to assist. I lived in 2 different apartments (floor plans 3x3 and 4x4), and both were well kept and in good condition. In terms of maintenance, they are super quick to respond. The amenities and fun activities to get to know other residents were great. I would highly recommend this apartment complex to anyone looking for a clean and nearby place to campus. I am going to miss this place!",5,Geo castillo
335,"Management used to be amazing, but they recently had a change. It is just average now. Now, the office is constantly closed  on random days and times, so beware of coming before 11AM and after 2 PM. The apartments are nice but expensive when new and more updated apartments are nearby. They also got rid of individual leases. If you are living with people you don’t know very well then stay away.",3,Jose Aborro
336,"This is one of the worst apartments I have ever lived in. The landlord was extremely hard to talk to and very rude. She would talk over you and try to intimidate you when you try to get a work order in. My shower spout broke and her recommendation was to use the sink to shower (it took her almost a week to fix). Then we had an ant infestation and she would just shrug it off. There were ants in the carpet, floors, kitchen, literally everywhere. And on top of that, the floor caulking of the bathtub was very badly placed which brought mold (a lot of it). She got mad that I would keep having work orders because the apartment was very run down. She would yell and bully me to the point that I needed someone else in the room with me because I did not feel safe. DO NOT LIVE HERE! If I can save someone from making the worst decision to sign this lease, don’t move here.",1,Elizabeth Ramirez
336,Do not recommend at all. The apartment was filthy and run down when we got it and for half of our lease we weren’t able to use our patio because fixing it wasn’t a priority. I moved out over a month ago and was told that I would be getting back less than half of the deposit even though we left the apartment in far better shape than we received it. Not to mention we just experienced an extremely hot summer with an AC unit that didn’t work. They also didn’t give us accurate images of what our unit would like before signing and they showed us images of an updated unit which is not at all what we got. Another thing that really bothered me was that they never honored their office hours so as someone with a full time job I could never speak to anyone when there was an issue.,1,Diana Rubio
336,"One of the worst apartment complexes I've lived in throughout my college career. The apartment was not cleaned when we moved in, the carpets were sticky and we found toenails in the drawers. They made us wait a week to move in to ""clean"" but never cleaned. Since the manager lives on site, he constantly goes home and closes the office at random times of the day when I needed to refill my laundry card or turn in papers to him. There was a random power outage in the office so we couldn't do laundry for a week. However, the apartments power was fine and his computer in the office somehow still worked? Please avoid at all costs, the manager is a good guy but not cut out for this business.",1,Allison Recancoj

If you have any prior apartment experience you'll definitely appreciate living here!",5,Kami Gendi
336,"I lived at Eastlake Apartments when I was an undergrad at UC Davis for 2.5 years. I had a very good experience living here. I highly recommend renting here if you are a college student. They have lower rates than other apartments in Davis because they are in the west side of town. Although it is further from campus, Eastlake comes with great amenities such as proximity to bus stops and a nearby shopping plaza.

The staff is very fair and compassionate people; they work with you and explain things. One person I held in high esteem was the groundskeeper John Shiner. He helped us with maintenance requests quickly and effectively. He once came late at night (11pm) to fix our water heater in the middle of the winter. He made my experience living at Eastlake better. The office (Nadia and Chris) are wonderful, friendly people. They are very accessible and are always willing to work with you to make sure you have a great rental experience here.",5,Johnny Ma
337,"Excellent place to live, extremely prompt with all communications and understanding if any issues arise with the housing. Over the years here any regular maintenance issue I've had was resolved within the day, after hours maintenance was also extremely prompt and helpful, and all done professionally. All staff are friendly, grounds are kept clean, concerns are promptly addressed and the amenities (gyms and study rooms) are always clean and well kept! Rooms themselves are spacious and the property maintains them well.",5,Katherine Cheng
337,"Note I’ve only been living here around a month, but so far this place has blown away my expectations. I’m extremely lucky to have won the lottery to live here. I was previously living at Sol at West Village which is in a similar location but La Rue has 2/3 the rent, arguably a slightly better location, and infinitely better maintenance (as soon as i told them i had a leak in my toilet they said hop in the golf cart let’s fix this now). Sol maintenance you put in a request and had at best a 50/50 they would actually come in a minimum of week then another 50/50 if they actually fixed the issue. Amazing people who actually care here and aren’t just after your money. La Rue ON TOP!",5,Michael Yang-Murray

337,"Not sure where to begin with how great Colleges at La Rue is, but the bottom line is this is THE BEST apartments in Davis for any student.

I've lived in West Village previously, which many people seem to think is the highest in Davis, but really it doesn't even compare in terms of friendly service, location, space, and value. The staff here goes WAY beyond just doing their job. Everyone I've interacted with here from the director, front desk, maintenance, all were extremely friendly and helpful, something that unfortunately is very hard to find in a lot of apartments.

For the price I am paying here, I would have had about half the space at West Village and I still would have had to pay extra for parking and bike a much farther distance everyday. Here, whenever there is an issue (which is almost never), I know its addressed very quickly. Even when there isn't an issue, maintenance always make the place better, even shampooing our carpets without request.

Everyone who comes to our apartment is jealous of our place, you really can't find places like this at this value in Davis. It's no surprise people try so hard to get an allocation at the Colleges, so if you have the chance to live here, do not hesitate to take it!",5,Diego Valdez
337,"I feel compelled to review because not only is the physical apartment great (location, spacious rooms, amenities, etc), the management is amazing. In a college town you get a lot of apartment complexes that could care less about their residents, but the Colleges at La Rue is not one of them. The management here is on it, they’re responsive and friendly. We’ve had an ongoing AC issue that they have addressed promptly with the utmost care; no AC in Davis could be brutal but they’ve offered us fans and AC units, and done everything in their power to us perfectly comfortable while addressing the issue. I will recommend the Colleges at La Rue to any student looking for housing, they rock!!!",5,Aimee LaGrandeur
341,"I lived here for a year and I would say if you can find something better, then go there. Our kitchen sink was clogged where the water would not drain. We contacted the maintenance team a few times but they never really came to fix the issue. We had to buy a toilet plunger to force the water to drain. The bathrooms do not come with vents, so by the time our lease was over, the walls were covered in mold even tho the window was open all the time to help with the airflow. We had a townhouse which meant the rooms were upstairs. The bedroom above the living room creaked everytime you walked. It was so bad that people in the living room found it very disturbing. The storage is great, but you get an older apartment.",2,Wendy Matias Berduo
341,"I highly recommend not renting here. Tamara the property manager is a nasty person, she is a racist and homophobic. She is hardly ever in the office and is non-responsive to calls and emails. Upper management needs to look into replacing her. She is the main reason we did not renew our lease. This property also has issues with roaches, and rats.",1,Roberto McGinley
341,"I regret living here so much. Please do yourself a favor and find another place to live. Please save your precious time and energy and do not deal with anyone from this apartment complex.
Anywhere else in Davis is better than this place.
On the outside, the apartments are shabby looking, the roof is literally falling apart on several units, the paint job is dreadful and dirty-looking. On the inside, the apartments/townhouses are cramped and small.
The maintenance used to be slow at responding but has gotten faster at fixing the problems around the apartments. There may be some rats in your units. Sometimes there are roaches crawling around the lawn in front of my unit.
Tamara, the manager here, is extremely unprofessional, rude, unresponsive, and makes no sense. We questioned her on why we didn't receive an email from her about a situation and she said ""your email was full"", which makes no sense... She cannot communicate about situations/mishaps without inserting her immature attitude.",1,Cathy Tran
341,"Maintenance does not do their job, Tamara in the front office is rude and lazy and is hardly ever in her office so if you do have an issue you have to call multiple times. Maintenance will gaslight you and tell you there’s nothing wrong with whatever needs to be fixed even when you have photographic evidence that it’s not working. The apartments are overrun with the roaches and the pest control guy has told us that most of the other apartments also have roaches. They come out and spray but the roaches always come back. The apartments are old and rundown appliances are at least 15 years old the bathrooms have mold which Tamara claims is not mold and says it is due to poor ventilation because the building is old and there’s nothing they can do about it. I had to get a mold test to prove it was mold. And the washers and dryers barely work.  Save yourself the time hassle and money and rent anywhere else in Davis",1,Svetlana Chezinsky

That’s why I decided to write a review about my apartment complex and say thank you to Wildhorse Terracina  staff  specifically Rebecca(manager).I moved here 2 years ago and I love the staff. They listen to me and fix any problems I have as soon as possible. The first month after I moved here, my oven did not work. Two days after I called the office I had a new oven.  The maintenance needs are completed within the same day. It could be the AC or toilet. The guy is friendly, polite and professional. When I call or stop by the office I am always greeted by my name and very helpful with any of my needs. The property overall is always kept clean. I have lived in so many apartment around the US. I’ve never seen any office manager like Rebecca. She is really considerate and nice. I usually come home after office hours but if she is in her office she answers  my question and solves my problem. I say a big thanks to the team.",5,Pooneh Mohajer

342,"Management told us that we would be without hot water for over a week and has failed to compensate us. This is a housing code violation under California law.  It’s winter, so the water comes out ice-cold.  Many tenants are now forced to shower at friends’ houses, waste time to move hot water from the kitchen into the bathtub, stay at hotels, or risk their health by trying to clean their dishes with cold water.

Here is what showering in Stonegate Apartments currently looks like: I had to go to Home Depot in Woodland to buy buckets and I have to boil water on the stove, which I then carefully move into the bathroom where I mix the hot and cold water.  I’m cleaning my dishes twice to try to lower the chances of getting sick.  All while paying nearly $1,900 a month (fees included) for a 1-bedroom that is not close to downtown.

Speaking of the rent, they told us that by re-signing the lease contract we will be paying less than the new tenants and it’s not true. Stonegate management is full of greedy power grabs and price gouging, so be warned.  I’ve lived at Stonegate for 3+ years and as a local guide I felt compelled to describe my recent experience facing this injustice.  We are still trying to live here without hot water.",1,Joshua L. Canepa Gallo
342,"After 3 years at Stonegate It’s disappointing to have to leave a review like others on here but I don’t want anyone else to be surprised by the management’s behavior.

Despite returning the unit in a great condition (validated by multiple property managers from other apartment complexes) & (minus a little carpet spot that we anticipated a small distinguishable extra fee for), we received multiple $130+ deductions from our deposit. After jumping through hoops to receive the vendor invoices legally obligated to us, there were no separate fees distinguishable from basic cleaning rates that were vague, broad, and incorrectly labeled. Therefore they were completely unable to explain how they came up with the Random ~$130 charges relative to the invoices.

There were many other uncomfortable situations with the management throughout the duration of the lease as well:

A few months in we complained about unmanageable mold overgrowth in the bathroom that appeared to be seeping out from behind the shower panels and fixtures, as well as inadequate ventilation, to which maintenance said “all units have mold in them, but we’re going to come take care of this because you guys take good care of your unit”.

The maintenance and management frequently gaslit us about issues, such as when our AC broke in the middle of a heat wave (115°F outside) and told us it was working fine and that we just needed to close our blinds during the day (which we always did) despite it being 95° in the apartment with the AC set to 58°. After 5-6 days of  insistent emails and office visits, they gave us a portable (which did not alter the apartment temperature at all, nor was it designed to cool a space of this size) and sent out a technician a few more days after that who immediately confirmed that the unit was busted and replaced it.  Not to mention a massive bee infestation on my patio that they did absolutely nothing about until there were thousands of dead bees piled up in the patio of the unit below me.

Furthermore don’t bother asking maintenance for help, since their solution was to fix everything with a poor silicone caulking job. The kitchen floor was peeling up, they fixed it with caulking. Roaches were coming from under the dishwasher, they caulked a peice of plastic to the from of the dishwasher instead of plugging their entrance behind it. Mold was seeping into the tub, the caulked over it.

Beware of a poorly lit parking lot ( which you also have to pay for if you need more than 1 parking permit), my car was egged, and my roommates car was broken into.

Also be warned about the hefty utility fees, which is ironic considering the utilities frequently have problems (see the recurrent hot water notices below).

The renewal rates are also incredibly steep and only reflect a few dollars off market rate—there is little incentive to stay.

Lastly, the apartment complex cycled through staff like water over the duration of my lease (though they may have slowed down for now), I’ve dealt with Anne-Marie, Jessica, Jazmin, Allie, Jahnai, Sabrina, Amy, and Ryan, but no one seems to be able to build good rapport with the tenants here (I’ve spoken to many).

I wouldn’t put it passed them to respond to this review and try to defend themselves, they tried in our conversations but my concerns and arguments mostly went over their heads. The whole thing feels like a cash grab since they have so many empty units.",1,Hannah Voorhees
342,"I lived in Stonegate Village for three years. The location was nice, quiet, and close to the west side of campus. There are plenty of bike paths to and from the campus and downtown. Overall, it's an OK place to live, but there are some things one should be aware of when considering moving here.

Many aspects of this apartment complex can be improved, and left much desired. For one, my unit only had a AC unit in the dining room area. There is no central heating/AC. My unit also did not have a dishwasher. The complex is quiet for the most part, but can get loud if you live next to the pool area. The amenities are OK. The gym is tiny. The pool is cleaned every day, which is nice, but is also small.

The laundry rooms are part of what makes living here difficult. Almost always, at least one machine is down. Machines are often all taken on the weekends, so I would often elect to do laundry weekdays at night. The rooms usually had a dank, moldy smell.",2,Croix Laconsay
342,"Had an upstairs apartment and it was nice enough (dated appliances and fixtures but gas stove, skylight, etc).  Quiet little complex right next to a park.  Not walking distance to downtown Davis but walking distance to a small strip mall with a market and some restaurants. Two stars for the very high security deposit and just general high cost for what you get.

The ‘refurbishing charges exceeding normal wear and tear’ were over half our security deposit.  We cleaned literally everything in the apartment and they charged us ~$180 for cleaning. There were nail holes in the walls when we moved in that I clearly made them aware of in our inspection sheet and they still charged us ~$90 for painting.  The carpets were new when we moved in and we vacuumed and cleaned them regularly and they still charged ~$100 for carpet cleaning.  How is cleaning the carpets not considered normal wear and tear?  We accidentally left a bag of dog food in our apartment when we moved out and they charged us $50 to remove it...

Not a bad place overall but don’t expect to get much of a security deposit back.  Very obviously an investment group owned property which can be a plus and a minus.",2,Dave Hash
342,"I loved living in this apartment complex for a year. The management and maintenance team are excellent, can’t have any complains. The apartment complex is very nicely located with biking and running trails around, and it is super green outside. The bus stop is also just a minute away from your apartment. The management even calls at the end of the week to make sure that your maintenance request was taken care of. I highly recommend this apartment in Davis.",5,Anubhab Gupta
343,"Lived here for about 2 years and Patricia, the manager, was very helpful. She helped us promptly. Any fixtures, they are logged in and attended asap. The apartment is located in a safe and good neighbourhood . Haven’t used Swimming pool, but have seen people using it. They maintain it well. The apartment is updated with security cameras, dedicated parking spot, digital payment washer dryers and keyless entry. We had a wonderful stay and just moved because they don’t have an in unit laundry.",5,Pavithra Sundaram
343,"I lived in Clubside apartments for a year between 2018 and 2019. The apartments are big and located in a quiet part of Davis, which is nice. However, it is really difficult to communicate with the manager or the maintenance. The manager is rarely in her office and the maintenance guy is usually just working on his bike by the pool.
Over the year I lived there, my toilet broke (the day after my move-in), as well as my AC and oven. It would have been fine if they had fixed it in a timely manner, but it took over a month each time. The only thing that was fixed in a three day delay was my water heater, which broke in the winter. The maintenance had previously said in front of me that it was ready to explode and flood our place. Yet it took reminding them at least three times for someone to do something. Also, I lived on the second floor and the light did not work for over half a year. It was always dark and I'd have to use a flashlight every night not to fall down the stairs. Finally, the pool was closed for all summer for repairs which was really tough given the heat.
Overall, I wish it had been easier to communicate with the manager and get my appliances fixed for the place to be truly habitable throughout the year.   If you are a person who  doesn't mind having to constantly remind them to fix the place or are yourself good at fixing things, I guess this complex would be fine. However, looking back on my time living there when some amenities didn't work makes me feel like this was the most stressful place I ever lived in. I would rather pay a little more for rent and live in a place that's habitable and gives you what's advertised in the price.",1,Elena Markantonakis
343,"Current Resident (Spring 2017)... The apartments are fine, very spacious but nothing is updated. They don't allow dogs which is annoying because almost every other building in the neighborhood does. Parking is available but it fills up because people let their friends park there (management never checks to see if people have permits) Manager herself is never really around, only time you will see her is when she's smoking by the pool or doing her laundry. The maintenance guy (her boyfriend) is always around fixing apartments people moved out of or cleaning the pool but mostly he's doing side projects and working on his truck (tool shed is attached to my apartment so I hear him in there until almost 1 AM every night). Right now the fan above my oven doesn't turn on, my AC blows out hot air, and there's a smell that comes from the bathroom sink. Every time I mention it I'm ignored. Laundry machines always leave my clothes dirty and damp (even on heavy duty setting), there's a ""lounge"" but its just a room with a pool table that only the manager has keys to. You would think that for $1,200 a month they would fix broken things in your apartment and you might get some amenities (I think the ""lounge"" should be turned into a small gym). Only good thing I have to say is that the rent is cheaper than most places in Davis and the residents are quiet.",1,Alyssa Eckels

344,"I’ve waited to post my review of this place to see if my new apartment was the same or if renaissance was truly that horrible and it is. Living at Renaissance was one of the worst apartments I’ve ever lived in. When we toured I asked how much utilities would be on top of rent and was quoted no more than $50/month. We paid nearly $200 every month just for gas and electric and almost $350-$400 during the extreme heat because the insulation is so bad that no matter what you do you have to run A/C and heat constantly because the walls don’t keep anything in or out. On top of that, we paid about $100 per month for all other utilities (trash water,sewer, etc). So we ended up paying on average $300 per month for utilities after being quoted only $50. As others have mentioned, trees and branches falling seemed to be a big issue every time there was a storm. One instance a giant branch was blocking our entire doorway and luckily we were visiting family in another state but if we hadn’t been, we were asked if we could make other arrangements while they got the branch sorted saying it was going to be a few days. They hadn’t offered any type of compensation or accommodation up front for the inconvenience which is honestly not very good customer service. Speaking of, every time I needed to go into the office the manager was rude. Maybe not intentionally but if you give off rude vibes or RBF it ruins the whole experience in itself and creates just an unwelcoming environment. If I could give this place 0 stars I would.",1,Danielle Almeida
344,"Coming from a tenant of 4 years, as you’ll see with most reviews from this apartment complex, this is a terrible place to live. You’ll acknowledge this the first time you have any issue with your own apartment or and neighboring tenants. You’ll acknowledge how little they care by their subpar responses of “sorry for your dissatisfaction with our service…”

I had multiple instances where they showed how little they cared for the people living here and/or making it a better place to live.

1. A tenant with a very illegally modified car would park right outside my and others windows, start their vehicle at 4am every weekday morning and leave it running for 10-15 minutes. This vibrated the windows, I slept with earplugs, a sound machine, AND even boarded up the window to just try and drown out a little noise with complete fail. After putting a couple politely worded letters on the owners car of asking them to either park anywhere else in the lot to not wake up the residents and getting no response, I made a complaint to the leasing office that did nothing. I had such bad sleep deprivation that I had to go on anti depressants to help with my stress because this car would wake me up everymorning at 4am without fail. The leasing offices response was that he didn’t want his car getting broken into so he refuses to move where he parks. Fair enough, I get that you can’t enforce where they park in the lot, but they should be able to regulate the car if it’s affecting the health of other tenants. After months and months of pleading for help, the leasing office did nothing
2. I witnessed a hit and run in a parking lot of theirs, put a note on the car that got hit informing them that I had the license plate of the car that hit them. After helping them, I was made aware that it was the partner of the owner whose car that was waking me up at 4am. Funny right? At this point I realized how little this couple cared for anyone else but themselves. A cop trying to get the insurance information for the owner who’s car was hit, went to the leasing office asking which unit they lived in, and was told that they wouldn’t give a police officer that information for an even an illegal activity that had occurred. The cop then came to my place asking for anything I knew about what was going on and told me that this was happening. So of course the leasing office was protecting this terrible couple for some reason which is highly unethical and unfair for any tenants whose lives were affected by them.
3. After 2 years in an upstairs apartment with my partner (previously in another unit for 2 years), and with record high heat waves in the area, we realized our air conditioning unit was not working and leaving our apartment to reside at 85+ degrees even if we were cooling our apartment all day to try and be at around 72 degrees. This made our bills about $550-$650 per month, not joking. Myself and my wife made the leasing office aware of this since we first moved in, and they did nothing but send out a maintenance person that gave us the run around saying “it’s just like that”. This made the apartment inhospitable and I would occasionally stay at a friends place because they actually had a working AC unit.
4. There are so many other instances like this that made living here incredibly difficult. I moved out because I got a job offer elsewhere and the only way out of the lease was to get another group to do a lease takeover. Knowing how bad this place was, I had a hard time trying to get anyone else to live here because I didn’t want to feel like I was tricking anyone.
Needless to say….. don’t live here, and I can guarantee that their response (if any) will show how little they care.",1,Nick Fraser Pk

344,"Like all the other comments have mentioned, they won't be returning any of your security deposit no matter what. They also charge for painting which is illegal in the state of California.

345,"I absolutely love my apartment and community! The amenities here are amazing. I frequently use the gym and the study lounge, both of which are incredibly convenient. The study lounge even provides free coffee and color printing services—such a thoughtful touch!

What makes this community even better are the various events organized throughout the year. They not only allow me to experience American holidays but also give me the opportunity to connect with other residents. During midterms and finals, the management provides special treats and meals, which truly warms my heart.

Oh! The weekly Friday cookies are an absolute must-mention! They’re my little sweet indulgence, the perfect treat to wrap up my week.

Whenever a problem arose, they would resolve it immediately on the same day, and they were kind and helpful even with small issues.

347,"We have lived in Davis for 10 years and Meadow Ridge was by far our favorite place to live. Since this apartment complex is about a 30-minute bus ride to campus, Meadow Ridge is more geared towards families and working professionals, which was ideal for us. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to the Nugget Marketplace and the best sushi restaurant in town, Huku Japanese Bistro. Meadow Ridge just updated their sports court, which meant playing tennis or pickleball was just a minute away.

The staff are wonderful and responds timely to any maintenance issues. Ion is very knowledgeable and works hard to fix everything onsite, from a leaky pipe to a broken washer. The office manager, Kristen, is always friendly and helpful when we had questions/concerns and made sure to keep an open line of communication.

We first lived in a 1x1 and then upgraded to a 2x1, and we always loved how spacious all the rooms were. It's also amazing that a good washer and dryer is included in unit - that's rare amongst Davis apartments!

If we didn't buy a house, we would have been happy to stay at Meadow Ridge. We recommend this apartment wholeheartedly.",5,Alex Massarsky

Unlike other places we've lived where updates only happen when things break down, Meadow Ridge comes with updated kitchens and windows, and is always improving features, like adding EV chargers, updating the sports court/pool, etc.

The staff are amazing as well. The maintenance staff, Ion, is very knowledgeable and professional. He knows how to fix everything from the drain to the appliances. When our dryer stopped working, he quickly found the root cause and made sure we had a working dryer ASAP.

The property manager, Kristen, is very approachable and helpful as well. Her clear communication keeps us informed about any upcoming changes, and she ensures any residents' concerns are heard and addressed.

352,"Sterling 5th Street is an amazing apartment complex to live in, the best in Davis! I couldn't recommend it enough! Let’s start with the pricing, which is modest and affordable, especially considering the incredible facilities. For the 2024 year, I managed to get my own private bedroom and bathroom in a 5x5 apartment for $1,099 per month. I’ll talk more on how Sterling compares to other housing options in Davis at the end of this review, but first, let me talk about the details of the apartment.

Apartment Features:
The 5x5 unit (their most affordable option) is incredibly spacious, much larger than any other apartments I toured in Davis. Each bedroom comes fully furnished (at no additional charge) with its own private bathroom, bed, desk, chair, and plenty of storage. My unit even has a spacious walk-in closet! There are 2 large windows that allow you to let in plenty of sunlight.

The private bathroom is massive, modern and with all-new fixtures. The common areas are equally as modern. The living room is large and comes furnished with comfortable couches, a coffee table, and a big TV. The kitchen has a huge island with 5 bar chairs for entertaining, plenty of cabinet space for all five residents, and new appliances. The in-unit washer and dryer are also large and new.

While you can hear noise within the unit (e.g., someone cooking or talking in the living room), it’s better soundproofed than any other student apartment I’ve visited in Davis. The walls between apartments are thick, so I never hear my next door neighbors. Traffic and train noise are nonexistent, even though I live on the south side around 300ft from the tracks.

Amenities:
Sterling’s amenities are the best! There’s a pool and a heated jacuzzi, study areas on every floor, and a large main study area with private rooms and free printing (30 pages/month). The game room features a pool table, and the community kitchen is perfect for hosting events. Wifi is fast everywhere.

The gym is my favorite amenity. It’s huge, well-equipped, with most equipment you can find at the ARC. With dumbbells up to 75 lbs, mirrors throughout, and great views of the pool, it’s convenient and saves me time and money from driving and parking at the ARC.

There are also BBQs scattered around the property, making it great to host gatherings. The secured parking garage is spacious, with plenty of spots even for general parking pass holders like myself. There is also a bike garage.

Staff and Management:
The staff at Sterling are fantastic! Shoutout to Angelina and Jonathan, who have been incredibly helpful and friendly every time I need assistance. The leasing office is open daily, and maintenance requests are addressed quickly (usually within 1-3 days). The team is polite, accessible, and always willing to help.

Location:
While Sterling is a bit far from campus compared to pther apartments in Davis, it’s manageable with a car. For bikers, the nearby bike highway to the West on the overpass works well!

Pricing Comparison:
Sterling stands out as the best value for student housing in Davis, especially with how new and great their amenities are! Other apartments for the 2025-2026 year charge upwards charge of $1,400-$1,700 for private rooms without private bathrooms, or $1,059 for shared bedrooms in overcrowded units like Identity, which accommodates up to 12 people. By comparison, Sterling’s pricing and modern buildings are unbeatable.

I moved in mid-Fall quarter of 2024, and initially hesitated to renew my lease due to being new. But after a month, and after touring other apartments for the 2025-2026 year, I realized how much better Sterling was. Unfortunately, I missed the opportunity to lock in the $1,099 rate for the 2025-2026 year but was offered a reasonable $1,229, which is still far better than any other private bed+bath in Davis for 2025-2026.

Learn from my mistake, sign up for Sterling asap (spots always run out!) and renew your lease early! This place truly offers the best student housing experience in Davis, with affordability, luxury, and convenience!",5,Justin Leong

Ari took the time to really listen to my needs and preferences, which made a world of difference in my search for the perfect apartment. She provided options that were specifically tailored to my situation, demonstrating a genuine understanding and care for what I was looking for.

Throughout the entire process, her guidance was invaluable. She was knowledgeable, patient, and incredibly responsive, making what can often be a stressful experience into a smooth and enjoyable one. Thanks to her expertise and dedication, I found an apartment that I'm absolutely thrilled with.

353,"My time at Aggie Square has been absolutely awesome! As an international student, I was all about exploring a new city, and Aggie Square quickly became the heart of my adventures. During my 2-year stay, every aspect of it was simply outstanding. Whether it was the super-responsive management or the maintenance team who fixed things at the speed of light, they were on it.

What's really cool is that we hardly ever had any big issues to worry about. The apartment was all spruced up and well-maintained. The only maintenance request in our first year was a routine check by the management to make sure the blinds were in tip-top shape and the pipes were clear. They were all over it before we even knew it!

And speaking of the management, they were like your friendly neighborhood superheroes. One of my best memories was the Thanksgiving bash with the Aggie community. We all got together for some great fun and even a lucky draw. Guess what? My roomies and I won Amazon gift cards worth $200, just for being awesome and renewing our lease without a rent hike. Sweet, right?

Aggie Square knows how to keep the surprises coming. At the start of the school year, we'd find donuts waiting for us, and during exams, it was fresh pizzas and more donuts. Plus, we could always count on top-notch Starbucks coffee to keep us going.

Looking back, I can honestly say that I had a blast during my 2-year stay at Aggie Square. It was the perfect introduction to California living. Huge shoutout to Lauren and Francisco, the dynamic duo who always had our backs. They were super cool and ready to help with anything and everything.

354,"Charged ridiculous moving out fee, and went straight to debt collection agency instead of notifying us. The only time they tried notifying us was through mail, which they will send it to your PREVIOUS address, not the permanent address. After that they will just toss the work to the debt collecting company with 1.09 star rating on BBB to match to their rating here. I can see why they work well together now.

This place will take your whole $900 security deposit and still asks for more. The whole time they will not show you any documentation of what or how the money was used, and if you do question about he price, you will get harassed by the debt company they hired. They don't care about customer service, especially about tenants that moved out already.

We had black mold in our apartment that was ignored and progressively got worse. In addition the work orders were never completed on time. We were told by maintenance that they would just paint over it- YIKES. We had water damage front winter storms near both doors and filters that they refused to replace.

Turnover at this property is constant- new property manager every six months. No one is ever is the office, they don't pick up the phone. The grass has all died, no bark or new grass is put down except in front of the office. The trees are constantly falling over or huge limbs breaking off. Ever since FPI Management took this complex over they have run it into the ground.

My and my college roommates moved to octave last year and at the end of August when we moved out, they send us a bill that we needed to pay almost 1000 dollars in damages on top of keeping our deposit money. They argued that the apartment needed reparations and extra cleaning services, when in reality when we first moved in everything was so dirty. The kitchen had never been clean from previous tenants, there was stains in the carpet, and mold in the washing machines. Maintenance did not help at all, and they wouldn’t even change a light bulb because it was cheap enough for us to buy one. They wouldn’t even have a conversation about the fees and us proving proof of the conditions of the apartment (they did 3 inspections before we moved out and they said everything was great). They sell your “debt” to a debt collection company right away even though they are illegally send you the receipt after 30 days of returning keys. DO NOT LIVE HERE.",1,Michelle Estrada

355,"Highly recommend! Quiet and well maintained apartment complex. Great WiFi access included in rent. 24 hour study lounge, gym and laundry rooms all kept clean and in working condition. Well lit at night. Unitrans bus stops conveniently in back of apartment complex, so you don’t have far to walk. Staff is very professional, courteous, and helpful and responds quickly to maintenance requests.  Full-time maintenance staff are very knowledgeable, and they get the job done as quickly as possible. Great place to live!",5,Ana Hopkins
355,"I took a walk-in tour with Chase today and it was one of the best experiences I have ever on a tour. He was personable and he gave me and my friend a lot of good information. I loved how he sent me a text immediately after my tour to see if I had questions. The property itself was also very clean, quiet, and I could really see myself living there. But I think knowing that Chase is in the office makes the biggest difference. I would highly recommend doing a tour.",5,Ethan Cheng-Luong
355,"I LOVED my experience at Arlington Farm Apartments. The rooms and common areas are huge, they are ON great bus lines (legit bus stops right by your door), have fun resident events, and great sense of community. Personally, I loved to study by the pool. If I got too hot, I could use the community study room and they always had snacks and coffee in there! Also, the closet was huge and the doors were a mirror. The housing office staff is amazing, and I would highly recommend. P.S. the buildings are super cute and my ootd pics always slayed.",5,Sarina Mugino
355,"I lived here from August 2021 - August 2022 and I am currently searching housing in another city and remembered how frustrating it can be to have to suss out whether a place is good or not on your own, so I decided to write this review because I really was very satisfied with my stay at Arlington Farm Apartments.  I stayed in the 4-bedroom two story apartment with three other girls from UCD.  The apartment complex is quiet and pretty and administration is very responsive to any questions or concerns that tenants have.  I will say, it's on the expensive side, but it's Davis, and you get what you pay for here. Hard to find any better pricing options.  The ladies in the office knew me by name even though they had only met me a few times.  I would move back there in a heartbeat.  Overall quality place of living.",4,Camille Flye
368,"The apartment units are decent and the maintenance team responds quickly for repairs. However, there's a pack of unsupervised kids with really bad behavior, that dominate the complex. They're loud, they swear and say crude things about sex and they congregate in the playground, so they smaller kids can't even enjoy it. Most of the good parents keep their kids inside and use neighborhood parks instead because the bad kids here make the playground and grassy areas unusable due to their behavior, fighting, and drama. In the summer, the pool gets closed for weeks at a time because of incidents related to these kids. Last summer, an apartment was egged and the police were called. The kids will also do things to deliberately provoke neighbors and then when the neighbor says something to them, they go get their low functioning family and friends and try to start a fight. The police are often called in these instances too. Last year someone was stabbed.

Also, a lot of drug recovery and domestic violence programs have been funneling people into the complex and it has really changed the atmosphere. These people are usually not quite ready to live independently and end up relapsing or inviting abusive exes to live here with them. They bring a lot of riff raff and drug activity around. There are constantly tweakers on bikes blasting music and dumpster diving. There have also been some drug sales in broad daylight.

Alhambra has become the Davis version of the projects. There's also a lot of hoarders who bring mice and roaches and ruin it for the tenants that keep their places clean. I've  lived here for seven years and the past 2 years have gotten worse and worse. I'm  looking to move as soon as possible.",2,High Vibes
368,"Armando is an absolute gem! After my recent move, I had a few issues that needed attention. He promptly addressed every work order I submitted, making my transition so much smoother. His efficiency and kindness are truly appreciated!",5,Behishta Aslami
368,"I moved to California from Florida last year. I had an amazing experience with my transition. I applied for several apartments in Sacramento and Woodland, and Alhambra was the first and fastest to call me back.
Angela, the secretary should be named Angel because she is always very prompt about ANYTHING I've ever brought to her attention.
She is always smiling and willing to go the extra mile with things in her scope of practice as well as outside of it. I don't know a person that could do it better.
I'm grateful for the beautiful community and amenities.",5,Nephitoria Williams

372,"We lived at Lanai Garden Apartments for three years, and my stay was a mixed bag. Here are some key points to consider:

Pros:

- Convenient location, close to Grocery Outlet, Dollar Tree, and Goodwill
- Spacious bedrooms and individual allocated parking right outside the front door
- Private backyard
- Single-story blocks, reducing noise concerns from neighbors

Cons:

- Neglectful maintenance; repairs often involved replacing old parts with used ones. They act like they’re doing everything to solve your issues but actually they don’t.
- Persistent pest issues, including roaches, snails, and mice (which caused significant damage to our vehicles)
- Theft from the garage, including stolen shoes and a baby stroller
- Unfair charges upon moving out, including cleaning fees and damages that were present before we moved in

While the location and allocated parking were significant advantages, the numerous issues we experienced made our stay at Lanai Garden Apartments frustrating. If you're considering living here, weigh these pros and cons carefully.",2,Tabinda Jabeen
372,"Tani the property maintenance manager is fantastic! Not only is she rapid with helping out on repairs, but she is proactive about assistance residents before we even think we need it. I have stayed at Lanai garden because of Tani and how amazing she is.",4,Emy Sievers
372,Very bad place to live,1,Nathan Acosta
357,"I have been a resident here for a little over 3 years. All in all, no real complaints about my time living here. The on-site manager Diana is fantastic and is always a great help regarding any concerns. And the maintenance man is also very prompt and always does a solid job fixing/replacing anything for us. Noise/sound is fairly manageable with the occasional bump or running footsteps coming from above but nothing that will affect one's sleep/focus.

Highlights of the place:
- Parking is pretty generous with its own dedicated parking lot as well as a good amount of street parking. Reserved parking is also an option but not really necessary in my opinion.

- Location is as central to Davis as it's going to get. 10 minutes or less in any direction to get anywhere by car and has several bus lines running right outside the complex",5,Edward Chang
357,"I've lived at the Viking apartments for a little more than 3 years now and it has been great. It's honestly such a relief that our apartment manager (Diana) is always responsive and helpful. She's on top of everything and always reaches out if we have any problems. Maintenance has also been great and they come in to fix any issues very promptly. Also, laundry is right down the hall so it was very convenient. The neighborhood is relatively quiet and the location is very close to all the grocery stores (TJ's, Savemart, Safeway). Overall, I really enjoyed living here.",5,Brenda Tran
357,"I lived at the Viking for two years and enjoyed my time there! The apartments are very homey and the rooms are very spacious which make sharing a room so much more comfortable! The manager , Diana , was always very kind and responsive. Very close to campus and downtown. Overall good experience.",5,Amy Tet
357,"Four stars because the building manager, Diana, is a gem. She’s super responsive, helpful with resolving issues, and understanding. The building itself needs some work and all the apartments need to be given an update. Biggest problem here is that other tenants are really dirty and careless. Dumpster areas are always a mess, people don’t pick up after their animals, and some tenants are loud.",4,Zach Castagnola-Johnson
357,"I've lived at the Viking Apartments for roughly 4 years and it has been a great experience. The apartments are cute (I've lived in a two bedroom and a one bedroom at The Viking), neighbors have been nice, management has always been so helpful, and the pool rocks in the summer. The apartment manager has always been helpful and kind in answering my questions/concerns. The maintenance team has been helpful in fixing any problem I've had over the years (and it's free!). The location is great, close to downtown, campus, local stores, and the Yolo Library!",5,Sheena Cuccia
358,"This residence has exceeded my expectations. Over the past three and a half years, I've experienced outstanding hospitality from the entire staff, including administrative and maintenance personnel, who have a welcoming atmosphere and usually addressing residents by their first names. The recent pizza and pool party, featuring generous prize giveaways, exemplified their commitment to resident satisfaction. Management, Danielle, Arianna, and Azeneth, are all awesome! Plus they are actively seeking our feedback on potential enhancements, events, and incentives. To stay updated on community activities, I recommend following their Instagram account!",5,Kell Lay
358,"I lived at Anderson Place for three years of my time at UC Davis. It is hands down the best apartment I’ve ever lived in. The management team is so kind, engaged and just happy to be there.

I couldn’t recommend this apartment complex more. 1000000/10!!",5,Camille Zeigler
358,"Great management and staff! Every time I made a request for maintenance or had a question, they were so quick and polite to respond. I am very happy with all the interactions I had with the staff! The complex was clean and well kept, the yard work was occasionally loud, but the grounds were clean and that’s what the cost is sometimes. The wonderful ladies in the front office (Danielle and Arianna) have always been extremely pleasant and kind. Super dog friendly and I know my dog and I will miss living there!",5,Vivian Crow
358,"This is a friendly community with excellent property management. The community is safe and beautiful community with laundry, free swimming pool, free study room, free gym for residents.

the place was very clean and the complex was very clean. the staff explained everything very thoroughly and were very helpful and supportive throughout the whole process.  I really felt like I was home and this was their main vision for every tenant that lived there.
Thank you Anderson Place apartments, you really know how to make someone feel at home.",5,Fad Fay (FayFay)
359,"I had a really bad experience with them. They went to the apartment at the end of the leasing contract, and they said the apartment was very clean and in good conditions, so verbally said it didn't need any reparation or additional clean process (my mistake: I didn't ask for form signed by them with this information). However, they forced me to pay more money than the deposit, due to pressures exerted by the debt collection company IQ Data in the name of Sharps and Flats. They made me pay for: Painting labor and materials (it's their responsibility according to California Tenants: A Guide to Residential Tenants’ and Landlords’ Rights and Responsibilities), apartment cleaning charges (California’s Department of Consumer Affairs: A landlord cannot routinely charge each tenant for cleaning carpets, drapes, walls, or windows in order to prepare the rental unit for the next tenancy), Drip pans, Traffic stains, Stretching DR LR hall plus clampdowns, Insurance (this was paid monthly), total damage charges, and utilities bills (this was paid before).
They didn't answer my emails and my requirements of proves about all this. This company has also many small claims due to similar situations.
I wish I could provide zero stars.",1,Catalina Valencia
359,"One UCD student to another, DO NOT LIVE HERE. They take advantage of students who have no time or money to take legal action. They took the entire security deposit from us, as well as every other student I know who lived there. In our case, we spent 4 days deep cleaning our apartment and left it it in better condition that we got it and still had to pay 500 dollars on top of our security deposit! Some of my friends had the time to go back and dispute this and Sharps and Flats admitted to them that they overcharged them. Save yourself the money and find another place. The management is also super condescending and maintenance will only fix things if it’s legally inhumane.",1,Lucas Halteh
359,"Horrible management that takes forever to respond and does not seem to answer or comprehend the question. Apartment didn't even look like it was cleaned inbetween tenants since ours still had trash leftover by the tenants on the walls. Their rent collection site inexplicably stopped taking payments other than credit and debit cards which incurs a 3.25% fee. There's also a $2000 dollar ""move in"" fee.",1,frostii
359,"Apartment was dirty and had damages at move-in which we were charged for during move-out even though none of the marks on the move-in checklist were addressed. They also charged us for an entire paint job even though all of the paint was the same quality as when we moved in. Also there is mold coming out of the water line, which is confirmed by multiple residents. Good luck if you signed a lease.",1,Jordan
359,DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!! They will scam you out of your security deposit and charge you $600+ extra on top of your security deposit. They are also illegally charging for normal wear and tear and saying they needed to paint our apartment. Make sure to document and take pictures of your apartment during move in and move out. Also make sure if they stole your money to dispute it with debt collections and fight the overcharge by small claims court (No lawyer required!!). They are taking advantage of college student and first time renters.,1,nyel lambert
361,"I lived at Sundance for about two years and I cannot be more happy about my experience here.

Apartments and amenities-The floor plan is spacious and every unit comes with free wifi. Swimming pool, Sauna and Laundry room are very well maintained.

Management-The team are all very respectful, and friendly. I had to move out before the end of the lease due to relocation. Rebecca the manager is very helpful at advertising the unit to find potential tenants. She is clear and professional, making the lease take over a smooth process.

Maintenance- maintenance issues are usually addressed within a day. Rebecca is very responsive to maintenance requests. I am especially thankful for the new maintenance crew Mark for his amazing work. He is very friendly, always greets people with positive energy, and goes above and beyond to fix the issue.

Wish the whole team all the best!",5,Ting Gong
361,"I lived at Sundance for 2 years to close out my time at UC Davis. This was by far the best apartment community that I lived at or visited during my time here. Not only are the apartments wonderfully spacious and well-maintained, but the amenities are also wonderful. I can’t say I’ve stayed anywhere else that has a sauna! The staff, both in the office and on the maintenance team, are incredibly friendly and respectful. I would give 6/5 stars if I could!",5,Christopher Sousa
361,"To start with pros, the staff was very good with answering questions via email and in person. Rebecca was super fast with responding and the repair staff fixed whatever I needed on on the same day.

Now the bad.
For almost $1700 a month for an ""individual lease"", having to share a kitchen and deal with single pane glass and thin walls that were terrible at rejecting and retaining heat in the summer and wintertime forced me to drive up the electricity bill (PGE separate btw). I'm currently back in the Bay Area and found a place cheaper than what this place is charging. Plus, needing to access the circuit breaker meant I had to go into my bottom floor housemates room in order to get to it.

Also, if any emergency comes up during your stay and you need to move out, good luck. Didn't matter if I was willing to pay extra to cancel. And yes, I went thru the process of trying to find someone to take over my lease. After telling them the price and learning that it was a shared space, I can't count the amount of times people ghosted or just said no to my face. Because of this, as I'm writing this review, I'm still having to deal with paying back people and recovering my emergency funds.

If you're sure you're staying here for a year, great. However, this place is not worth what they're charging and are fueling the problem with why housing is so expensive in Davis.",2,Jeremy L.
361,"Hi Everyone,
I do not write reviews in general, but writing this one as I am positively surprised by the customer service and the overall experience I had with Rebecca Seltzer and the Sundance management team.
I am an upcoming graduate international student. I was looking for a spacious house close to campus. A senior of mine suggested that I should search for houses among Tandem Properties houses as they are well maintained and they manage even on-campus houses.
Rebecca and the team were extremely helpful in the process: they did a live video tour, explained to me in detail about all the facilities, and answered my queries patiently. The lease signing process was very smooth and they guided me as required.
I am looking forward to living in this community!",5,Abhinav Kishore

362,"Love Cranbrook so much! The service is always so wonderful and the staff are accommodating, welcoming and informative. The maintenance crew is amazing—prompt and knowledgeable. The apartment complex is dog friendly and only a 10 minute walk from a dog park. There are a number of useful amenities (pool, hot tub, gym, free printing, laundry services), and the wifi provided is high quality. The apartments are conveniently close to bike paths and bus stops for easy travel, and there’s plenty of parking.

If you’re considering whether the price of renting here is worth it, it absolutely is!",5,Debby Tiner
362,"Recently moved away from Cranbrook. Miss the ambience and peace. The cranagement has always been soo helpful and understanding! Chrissie is the best! And not to mention the awesome and quick maintenance team. Sergio and Rafael helped a lot in any quick repairs and Roberto even helped repair my bike! Morning cookies and coffee are always a treat! The common room has been a place for many celebrations including an impromptu ring exchange ceremony! Apart from a bit far from campus, I really did enjoyed my stay!",5,Amey Gohil
362,"Living at Cranbrook Apartments has been a wonderful experience! Krissy and the management team, “Cranagement,” are absolutely fantastic. They’re always quick to respond and go above and beyond to ensure any issues are resolved the same day. The property is beautifully maintained, with lush green trees creating a serene atmosphere. Parking is never a problem, and the common room feels just like home with its cozy, welcoming vibe. I'm glad I chose to make Cranbrook my home!",5,Tejas Patil
362,My wife and I have lived at Cranbrook for 21 years. Yes since 2003 so I can speak on how awesome this place is. First of all it’s a safe place and near 2 shopping centers and a large park. But even more the staff is amazing. From the ladies in the office who run the place to the maintenance guys who keep your home running regular. If there’s a problem it’s fixed quickly. If you have a concern it is heard and not put off. The place is a blessing and we plan on staying until we can find a house.,5,Mike Harmon
362,"I've lived in many different places throughout the U.S., and I cannot overstate how lovely my experience has been with Cranbrook. Where my previous rental companies/landlords have failed, Cranbrook consistently succeeds. Their management team is friendly, accommodating, and easy to reach; their maintenance team is skilled and quick to respond; and the location is great, with plenty of parking, easy access to downtown, and a laidback atmosphere.

I highly recommend this place for anyone considering moving to Davis.",5,Antonio Giorgi
363,"This place is not worth its close to 3k rent price. I wanted to love this place and was excited to move in. The pool is beautiful, the rec room is modern and nice, and the fitness center is great. The apartments themselves where you hope to be at home is where they fall extremely short. There is absolutely NO good AC whatsoever, the air vents don’t work at all in the bedrooms and there is one singular vent in the living room. The room temp never got below 89 and the apartment always felt like a sauna. We found ourselves eating out daily because of the peak hours being unbearable with no good AC and we couldn’t use the kitchen appliances or else it would be way too hot. There were cracks on the walls in many places. The paint job is so badly done that every single door sticks and when you open it, it makes such a loud noise. Everything sticks to the cabinet shelves because it’s so hot in the apartments. The wifi sucked and they decided to get rid of it and make residents pay for their own on top of increased rent pricing. All utilities had to be paid separately on top of rent. Every week the trash truck would come at 5am and wake the whole building up. The trash area was always destroyed and messy. There are bugs EVERYWHERE outside and they get into the apartments so easily. The doors and windows were always covered in layers of spiderwebs. All shutters on outside windows had fallen off. On top of all that, they REQUIRED we pay for an ENTIRE day at the end of our lease yet they required we be out by 7am. When asked why they got to decide when we leave yet we pay the whole day, they stayed silent knowing they were in the complete wrong. As if that wasn’t enough, their stairwells are unsafe and so wobbly it was unsafe to walk up most days. Overall this place is not worth the money, they put their money into their own office renovations and nothing into the apartments which look like they were built in the 1970s and never worked on. Would not recommend this place, you can find better for cheaper or the same price.",1,Angelina Osley
363,One of the most worst of all apparent in davis  we move here just 2 days ago and there Are lot of problems going on here  bathroom taps work not properly and have lots of ants on the floor.  And the carpet was so bad and has lot of dust and hair everywhere. Ac work very bad. And the rent is too high and the unit condition is so poor.  I leased it for one year and I feel bad for it.  0 rates,1,Karanjit pb06
363,"The management's performance has been unsatisfactory. We have encountered a significant issue with mold resulting from water leakage from the ceiling due to their negligence, which has resulted in damage to our belongings. Despite repeated notifications, management has failed to acknowledge or address the problem, leading to prolonged exposure to mold over the past few months. We will seek legal action to resolve this matter since they are ignoring our concerns.

Update: after 6 months of exposure to mold with management doing absolutely nothing, we took them to court and management finally try to offer us 1 month of free rent for our trouble for over half a year.  Thankfully the court was reasonable and allow us to be compensated for the trouble :) never living here again and highly recommend everyone to live somewhere else",1,Hana Tran
363,"Apartment in shambles when I moved it. The gym is horrible; half the equipment doesnt work and neither does the TV in it.  Theres no pool heater. So many things broken when I moved in, like window screens. Almost NO lightbulbs and ceiling lights in the entire unit. Has shag carpet, gross. When I moved in, all the carpet smelled like bong water.  Insane bug issue. Bugs EVERYWHERE and they surround the doors. In unit washer and dryer barely work. Above all, their wifi doesnt work. It just flat out doesnt work. They promised they were working on it and its been 7 months. Still doesnt work. Kitchen layout horrible designed. Rent is far too expensive for how bad this place is. Closed amenities (game/chill room) for no reason and got fined for going in. They focus their maintenance on unnecessary things like retiling the pool and it looking even worse after. No free parking.  Homeless people constantly around. Moving out ASAP when lease ends",1,Regan Bergers
363,"The utilities are super expensive here, $70 a month for sewage, $40 a month for trash, $40 a month for water, and now they will be charging another fee for parking in the parking lot for the next lease term. This is all in addition to your pge bill which will unfortunately be really high if you like temperature control because there's really bad insulation in the units (air escapes in through every window frame). Know that the rent is $150-200 more every month than the rent is advertised because of these utilities (not including gas and electricity) and the utilities prices can be changed at any time during your lease agreement, which can be really hard with other prices rising right now. The prices do not really reflect the units themselves unfortunately, although the amenities are really great and management is nice. During our lease, the company Cambridge House uses changed and utilities increased dramatically to these prices. The amenities don't really reflect THESE prices, and the units by far don't. Highly recommend not living near the dog park as it is unfortunately fake turf so even when it's well cleaned it smells pretty awful, and the trash bin for the dog droppings gets pretty full and is unbearable.",1,Bailey Weber
364,The best apartment complex I’ve stayed in. Office people are so so helpful and so so nice. I’ve had some things that needed extra help from them and they didn’t have to but they helped anyways. Maintenance is super fast and super helpful too. There is a small but decent gym. Free printing with your own paper and it is super convenient. They also feed poor college kids during finals week cuz students forget to eat and they serve good food too. I just wanna say I appreciate the 3 years I stayed over there and I couldn’t ask for more because everything was perfect.,5,Jenavieve Zhao

I have never been so impressed by so many different people that greeted me and went out of their way to make sure things were fixed in a timely manner when my ac broke and I was made to feel comfortable and not like I was a burden when I was inquiring about the timeline of said repair to my ac unit . I see the ladies from the office going above and beyond and the way the maintenance workers were so quick to provide a solution and communicate with me and update me is not seen very often.

366,"I have been here for about three years now and do enjoy living here.
Pros:
amazing maintenance
Quiet but there is the very rare party
Great scenery

Cons:
Management lose files despite resending them twice.
Despite being a VERY expensive apartment, you have to wait to use the washers and dryers frequently due to them being limited and in two small buildings
The apartments are up to date to an extent. You can tell by the appliances that this complex has been here for a while.

Would I recommend living here? Yes but the price is a tad too much considering above. There is other apartments that are very up to date for the same price. Where you can do your laundry without lugging it from your apartment to another building and then wait in the line. Btw the maintenance team was the best part of this place. They are too amazing and kind.",4,Karma Kai26
366,"While the apartment complex presents a decent exterior, appearances can be very misleading.The apartments are very outdated in terms of structure and fixtures:

1.	Windows are neither soundproof nor windproof, paper-thin, and are challenging to open.
2.	Outdated appliances with limited functionality that tend to be very noisy.
3.	Thin walls allow noise from neighbors both upstairs and outside.
4.	External air conditioning units generate significant noise, especially when multiple units operate simultaneously, disrupting sleep and everyday activities.
5.	Persistent ant issues due to unseen gaps in the walls; we learned they often reside within the walls.
6.	Aging cabinets were dirty, sticky and visibly worn when we moved in.
7.	Frequent issues with washing machines being out of service, coupled with their subpar cleaning performance, makes laundry day always a hassle.

The only commendable aspect of this complex is its maintenance team. They’re prompt, professional, and skilled, although their workload could be significantly reduced if the units were in better conditions.

Upon moving in, we found many areas that were superficially cleaned but were extremely dirty upon closer inspection. It took us days to clean everything again so that we don’t feel grossed out all the time. However, despite thorough cleaning when moving out, we were still charged the full cleaning fees.

Last but certainly not the least, our rent was increased annually during our two-year stay with no updates nor improvements done to the unit whatsoever. The only reason apartments like this are still in business while being able to charge exorbitant rent and fees is because of the monopolistic housing market in Davis. It’s a shame how much one has to pay for conditions apartment like this has to offer.",1,Erica Y
366,"The Willows is a fantastic place to live. It is peaceful as it is near the farms and has a beautiful environment. The maintenance is excellent here, led by Sam. Sam and Casey, the maintenance group, are very hardworking and have quick and efficient service. If Sam and Cessey were not here, then this place would come to a stop!

366,"I have lived in 3 different apartment complexes (in Davis/Woodland region) over the last 5 years and life at Willows has been the best experience. I can definitely say that it is my favorite place in my last 10 years in the US. When I first moved in, I lived in their model unit and later moved to a regular 2BR unit.

Excellent management: The entire team goes above and beyond to address any requests. Every single time I went to them, I have walked out of the office as a happy person. I am moving out of Willows next week and the management was also very helpful with the subleasing process.

Commute to campus: Well connected by P and Q lines. D and K lines are about 6-7 min walk from Willows.

Shopping: For any quick needs, K-circle is just across the road. They never say NO to give quarters for laundry.

Gym/Laundry/Parking: Gym is small but is open 24 hours. Laundry is also open 24 hours. It is busy in weekends. Parking is free and there are no reserved spots.

Pleasant surroundings: Lot of green spaces within the complex. Also, very pleasant to go for a run along the adjacent farms. As a Willows resident, one can also avail membership for the Stone Gate Club for a 10$ fee (per month).",5,Elayaraja Muthuswamy
367,"I've only lived at the Grove for 6 months, but by far one of the best complexes in Davis. I've lived at multiple complexes in Davis. Let me say, Jessica (the landlord) is awesome. One of the best I've ever dealt with. She's very kind, and understanding. Some landlords I've dealt with are jerks! Not Jessica, shes great. Second, the maintenance guy is incredible he actually takes great care of the complex throughout. From the dumpsters, grill area, to laundry. It's always clean and well kept. I also like that on this side of town there aren't many homeless people walking throughout the complex. The complex feels like home, quiet and cozy. I would definitely recommend.

367,Jessica(the manager) and Suri( maintenance) are the two hardest working and nicest people i have ever dealt with in over 40 years of renting in davis!! I made the huge mistake of moving to another complex and i moved back to enjoy the best management ever!!,5,Cliff Mott
367,"Writing this review on move out day. I’ve lived here two years, and my brother 3 years.

Cannot say enough about how kind, considerate and timely management and maintenance have been the entire time. If I have an issue, maintenance is there same day. I always forget his name, but the maintenance manager who I’ve dealt with is amazing. He explains the issues in a way that make sense, and will often fix things we didn’t even realize were broken. Like the caulking on my toilet needed to be redone, he was there the same day and also noticed that my bathroom door was slightly askew, so he fixed that too.

As for management, Jessica is kind and patient and works WAY too hard. Girl will answer my emails after business hours and I appreciate the devotion. She is adept at problem solving, and has always gone the extra mile for us as tenants.

I cannot stress this enough. Every apartment / house I live in from now on will be working against my experience here at the grove. My fear is that I’ll never experience such an on-hand, communicative team as what’s here at The Grove. I might be talking myself into moving back in next year lmao I definitely feel like I took them for granted. Thank you guys for providing such an easy-going tenancy.",5,Mickayla Southard
367,"I’ve lived here for a year now, and it’s good! I would recommend The Grove to anyone considering it.

I’m pretty surprised to see some negative reviews for the management here. Maybe I’ve just been lucky, but Jessica has answered all our questions within the same day (even when I emailed on a weekend or holiday), and all of our maintenance requests have been completed within one or two business days. The management is extremely helpful!",5,James Campbell
369,"DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!

Absolutely the WORST experience I have EVER had renting an apartment.  Cockroaches everywhere!  I was terrified of going into my own kitchen and bathroom!  The wood under the sink in the bathroom was warped and smelled of rotten eggs.  The screens in the windows were held in place by wires and had tears and holes in them.  The bathroom door lock was on the outside instead of inside the bathroom.  The front door was crooked so you had to lift the handle to open and close it and there was still a gap when it was shut. Blinds were missing, and the sliding door to the kitchen was stuck and wouldn't slide at all.

Even worse than all this disgusting stuff was the fact that the management refused to fix these things.  When we were given the keys and the inspection form they promised to fix the sliding door and the blinds but they ended up refusing to fix the door and it took two months to fix the blinds.  When I emailed about the roaches several times and was only given a few traps and sprays for them, the management posted a letter on our door asking us to stop harassing them.

Finally, we were promised going into the lease that we would not be charged a cleaning fee unless the apartment was in  horrible condition.  Before leaving the apartment (only three months after moving in because it was so awful) we received a paper saying that we wouldn't be charged a cleaning fee unless the manager deemed it unclean.  During our checkout the manager said it was cleaner than she'd ever seen the apartment and again said there would be no cleaning fee.  When I was charged $100 out of my security deposit I emailed her complaining that she lied to me on multiple occasions and that we even had a document saying that we would not be charged, however she replied: ""The $100 that we charged you goes to her cleaning supplies and time it takes her, we do not take any of that money. She usually charges $200-$250. You apartment was clean and that is why she didn't charge you as much as she usually does, but the apartment still needs to be ""move-in ready"" for the next tenants. I never said that you wouldn't be charged for cleaning.  As stated in your lease and prior to you moving in I told you the rates for cleaning and the most common cost that are deducted from you security deposit so you could plan accordingly.""",1,danica pearce
369,"Looks nice, good pool, but cockroaches everywhere. Dealing with the inept staff was frustrating because after three ""bait"" treatments by three separate pest control people that didn't help the problem at all we were told to stop harassing the management about the infestation. Seriously three requests in two months about a cockroach infestation is called harassment? Not to mention had several other maintenance issues like screens falling out of windows in the middle of the night.",1,Alan Pearce

Also, I really love the gas stove and the in-unit washer & dryer inside the apartment. The environment around the apartment is quiet and beautiful. I enjoyed walking through the small roads among the apartment complexes, or looking outside and drawing the scenery outside while sitting next to the floor-to-ceiling window. It is very relaxing for me. :)",5,Yixiao Lu
371,"These are the best apartments in Davis. Close to campus, market, restaurants... The management is extremely efficient and responsive, always on top of every little detail. The swimming pool area and spa is always clean and ready to use. We love that is is a quiet place with great facilities (great gym too!). A plus is also how they organize small events for Halloween, Thanksgiving (turkey raffle), and even a Santa letter from the North Pole for those who have little kids. My daughter loves to send her letter to Santa and receive a letter for her directly from the North Pole! These details make this place unique. Cannot imagine living in another place in Davis. Kyra and Lauryn are always kind and efficient on their work! I strongly recommend this place for young families, students and professionals in Davis.",5,Thenesoya V. Martín De la Nuez
371,"We have loved living here. The apartments are beautifully refinished, the exteriors are almost done and will look amazing, and I can't say enough nice things about the staff and maintenance staff. Layce, Marissa, Kyra, and Ricardo are the people you want to have managing the apartment complex you live in.

Some things that put this complex miles above others in the area: gas stoves, washer and dryer in unit with a storage area above (in the 2 bedroom units), plenty of storage, new flooring and countertops, the community, and the staff. We've also enjoyed the greenery areas and mature trees that extend throughout the complex. It goes a long way to reducing stress when you have a beautiful green space just outside your window. Yes, living here is a bit more expensive than other complexes but you get a lot more as well. We had a few problems come up while we lived in Davis (nothing where the apartment was at fault) but it was always reassuring to have such understanding and wonderful people as neighbors and managers. We will miss living here.

As for the recent reviews about construction: yes there is construction going on in the short term. It was clearly stated in the contract that construction would be going on this year. They also give us plenty of notice when construction would be affecting us. I can understand that living through construction can be disruptive but it's never been terrible and the final results are worth it.",5,Crystal McClure
371,"I love everyone who works here at Tanglewood. Location is great, walking distance to the store, bus stops in front of the property that will get you all over Davis. It doesn’t make me miss having a car.",5,Mariluz Buchanan
371,"Except the big room, I am not satisfied with a lot of things here. First, terrible pest control. We found some cockroaches in bedrooms and asked for pest control. Unfortunately, after pest control, cockroaches are not completely removed. The scheduled pest control time was 9am, and they came at 3pm that day( I remembered it very clearly, because I stayed out until 8pm to come home). I think they only sprayed the living room briefly. Second, sometimes when we talked to the leasing office, they are not that professional and unfamiliar with what they are doing. Third, the reason why I moved out is they are going to force each unit to pay for the parking area, not assigned for free like before, which is unacceptable for me, especially the overall rent will increase a lot as well. Terrible, bye bye.",1,Melissa Chen
373,"I lived here for 3.5 years and it was a great place to live in Davis. The pool is beautiful and we enjoyed using it each summer. It is also big enough to swim laps in for a workout which is a huge plus. Management was very responsive and reasonable. The private outdoor area for our 1st floor apartment was great to have and was definitely more space than you would have at most apartments. If I wasn't relocating out of state, I would have stayed here for at least a few more years!",5,Kristi Aforismo White
373,"I had to find an apartment pretty quickly for a short term lease due to the pandemic and I’m really glad I chose to live here. Residents are very respectful and the manager Erica is extremely friendly and quick to take action. The walls are fairly thin, especially the wall facing the stairs, but it’s to be expected anywhere in Davis. I never got to take advantage of the pool, but it’s huge and really nice. I love how close it is to the bike path and a bunch of parks.",5,Evan Brosnan
373,"I lived in this apartment complex for about a year. The staffs were very kind. The apartment was very quiet and clean. They have a swimming pool, laundry, and other facilities that are kept clean throughout the entire year.

373,"Good neighborhood in East Davis. Close to Nugget and dry cleaners/restaurants. Lived here for 1 year. Rent is fair. Facility is clean and quiet, pool is enjoyable to use and not crowded during summer. No problems with package delivery. Manager Erica is a pleasure to interact with. She cares about details and will call on maintenance quickly and effectively. Maintenance workers are sometimes loud, but that's to be expected.

Docking one star solely because of poor thermal insulation and occasional dirty washing machines in the laundry room.

Example: I returned from a 3 week long vacation in January to find my apartment at 49 F!!! Brrr...",4,Vlad Ghita
373,"Within the last 6 years I've bounced around 5 different leasing companies/complexes across Berkeley and Davis, and I can confidently say that Clearwater management is the best I've ever experienced. Erica, the complex manager, is very approachable about maintenance/general requests and she takes tenant's concerns very seriously; regardless of how big or small they are. JP, the maintenance man, takes care of maintenance requests quickly and efficiently too. Based on what I've experienced in the past, such attentive management is quite rare and is a HUGE appeal for this complex.",5,sarah Mendoza
374,I lived there for two years and I moved out a year ago. The other review is true. They take all your deposits even if you do the cleaning. My two roommates moved out with me. They’re from the law school and they sued the apartment for taking their deposits. They successfully took back their deposits. I’ve consulted the court in Woodland and am going to do the same to get back my deposits. Make sure to take photos when you first arrive and before you return the keys.,2,Tian Xia
374,DON'T LEASE HERE. 8th and wake is so unprofessional. I understand that leasing offices get busy but they always fail to pick up the phone and return my calls. I really thought that their apartments were nice but if this is their customer service I would not lease here. Why should I waste my money on a place that won't even pick up the phone to assist me with my questions about leasing. It makes me think that they wouldn't help me with resident needs if I moved in. Good customer service should not be something that I need to be fighting for but here I am.,1,Ethan Cheng-Luong
374,"It was the first place where I stayed in Davis. Housing is nice, nice reading rooms, entertainment space available.  My first year here was nice as my roommates were clean and the common area used to stay clean if someone cleaned it. My second year here was bad to say the least because of random roommate selection policy and I got unlucky.Parking spots are available for free. The only complaint is, they never out ink i the north building computer. I heard the freeway noise but got used to it. Lift would break once in a while but I was onbothered as I lived on the second floor. Overall I liked the place.",4,Nushrat Naushin
374,"Overall it was an acceptable place to live and fair given the price. The location is great and overall management was responsive and quick with repairs. The apartment was clean and there was always plenty of parking. I'm giving it 2 stars because there were a couple major things that irked me when I was there. The majority of the apartments are on the west side of the building which gets constant loud freeway noise at all hours which limits opening the window. The elevator broke multiple times in the winter, once for a fairly extended period of time, which meant carrying my bike up and down 4 flights of stairs each day. Also, expect them to take your entire security deposit ($500) which to me is ridiculous considering my room was undamaged so they must have taken close to $2000 for the ""cleaning"" and repainting the entire common space of the apartment after I moved out, even though we did a pretty decent job of cleaning. Overall it was a fine place to live since I knew no one in Davis but I would not sign a lease here again, given there are other places to find cheap rent.",2,Sam Dudley

Half way through the year they changed management, completely switching over payment systems and contact emails. The switch was not announced clearly and we were receiving attitude for not paying on time when we had already paid on the old system previous to the announcement. Additionally, we repeatedly had problems within our unit, in winter our heat was out for almost a full week making it very uncomfortable and it took them 4 visits to resolve the problem. At the end of our stay we cleaned the apartment fairly and were still charged over 1000$ for “heavy cleaning” with no real explanation.

393,"If you want timely processing of any kind of paperwork at this property DO NOT RENT HERE.

Me along with two people I know (who also lived at the property) were looking to leave our leases early and get them taken over by new people. We found people to take over our leases and sent emails to the leasing office about a lease transfer request and it took more than TWO MONTHS for the leasing office (SHARON!) to send the paperwork.

This was AFTER we had each called and emailed (with no response) and then physically went into the office to ask what was going on and why nothing had been sent out. Every time we went into the office, Sharon would say ""Oh yeah I've been meaning to get to those, we're so busy, I'll finish them this week"" Empty promises of finishing it by the end of the week EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. for TWO MONTHS!!

See at first we were understanding, and gave her the week she SAID she needed to finish, then weeks went by and nothing. Until one day I legitimately came into the office and saw Sharon sitting in the window sill of the leasing office with a plant in her lap chit chatting with the other leasing agent there. They also couldn't manage to respond to our emails BUT could manage to send out a google form asking what people wanted for breakfast. Some real productive work there!!!

It got to a point where my friend's replacement literally dropped out and she had to find a NEW ONE and my other friend's replacement started reconsidering the whole thing because of how long it took for Sharon to DO HER JOB.

Sharon, if you're reading this, I genuinely don't know how you still have a job and why they hired you in the first place when you're clearly so beyond incompetent and LAZYYY.

Save yourself the headache and do not rent here. The apartments are also really old and all of the windows have mold.",1,Malia Duong
393,Malia is right about the paperwork issues. You can apply here and they'll pretend to look at your rental application but in reality they won't reply back. Yolo Property Management has no incentive to help current residents at all because they know you're stuck here.,1,Jason Moore
393,"I’ve lived here for about 6 years, starting in a 2 bedroom, then into a 1 bedroom. I’ve been lucky to have a washer/dryer in both units- it makes a HUGE difference! The property is beautifully maintained, with landscapers tending the trees and plants every week.
The office and maintenance staff are incredible; very responsive and friendly. Sharon is an amazing manager, she puts her heart into her job. She’s so very sweet and kind, and a very attentive property manager. Gilberto is the on site maintenance guy, always very prompt, friendly and fun to chat with. He’s always working his hardest, even in rain and 100° summers! You’re the man, G!
Although things are tough right now due to the pandemic, I feel very lucky to be living somewhere I feel safe. Whenever the staff need to enter the unit (inspection, maintenance reqs etc) they have their masks on and are happy to practice social distancing.

It's super close to Safeway, Panda, and Gong Cha. It's about a 10 minute bus ride to campus. The buses are very frequent as well, usually every ten minutes. However, they do get packed at certain times.

377,"Came up on the wait-list twice here and there was always some reason I couldn't proceed. First, they told me my income wasn't valid when it was. Waited a month to hear back after she told me she would get back to me. During this time, I called and emailed frequently. No one responded and the voicemail was full each time. When she finally did get back to me after being on leave, the apartment was ""no longer available."" That manager (Thalia?) is no longer there and I'm wondering if it's because of the way she operated buisness. The second time I applied paid the fees and provided hours of my time to provide info just to be told the tenant moving changed their mind and wasn't moving. I was then asked to apply to a smaller unit which I declined as it wasn't the size unit I was on the wait-list for. What gets me to me most is how the new manager acted as though I had everything in the bag and even showed me a similiar unit to the one I applied for so I had an idea of what my new place was going to look like. Then, after I hadn't heard back in a week or so I had to reach out to learn the unit I applied was no longer available. I emailed and called quite a few times before they finally responded. It was like they were avoiding me. Shortly after this I was sent a letter asking me to confirm  that I wanted to remain in the wait-list when I just had expressed to the management that of course I wanted to stay in the wait-list-- obviously as it wasn't my fault they offered me a unit that wasn't even technically available. I did this via email. I have email proof that I'm supposed to be called when the next unit that is the size I applied for comes up. I honestly have a weird feeling like perhaps management is doing shady things here? Maybe helping friends move in, by skipping over people on the wait-list? I just can't feel positive after being given the run around twice. Who knows, but the ratings probably speak to the quality of this place as well as how management runs things.",1,Electric Butterfly
377,"This is the worst area of Davis. Welcome to the ghetto: This complex has an atrocious environment: There are currently many jobless drug addicts living at this place.

For instance, the cops had to be called on numerous occasions due to late-night altercations next to the complex playground.  Cars are constantly vandalised in the parking lot, and all the past managers have displayed their incompetence. One resident stole the car of another.  If you have children, they will mentally suffocate, since they have no freedom in the unit.

378,"I'm leaving this message to complete the agreement between me and the community manager. (YOU can skip to next paragraph I leave this comment bc they asked me to) I think it's one or two weeks ago the weather raised to 110 - 115 and out AC was not functioning for almost a week. The leasing manager did came in and provide us with a portable AC but it does not help under that kind of weather. So I saw there was a rating email that got send over to me so AI rate them with a 1 star and left a not so polite message but very honest one on there. For the record I did not know that this comment will be publicized or get viewed by other superior. And I'm normally a nice person, the AC and the killing temperature forces me to be mean. So after I posted the message the leasing manager talked to my roommate firs and called me to change the comment that I left. the call went okay I agreed that I will change my comment not the rating on that post. BUT I was not able edit the post so the leasing manager said to leave a message here.

Ironically, after other superior saw my ""impolite"" message our maintenance problem got fixed within a day, where it normally will take more than 2 weeks to see a person coming. So I just want bring awareness to the resident and the people who want to be here. Your problem will be not be fixed on time unless the company need things from you.

The amount of cigarette butts that litter the front of this apartment complex is ungodly. The ground is practically covered in them. Gross. Who throws cigarette butts on the ground until the ground accumulates into a sheet of tobacco filth? The tenants who live here, that's who. Not to mention the instability of the people who are constanly fighting, screaming at all hours. Whoever owns this property, getting all their government kick backs and clearly not monitoring the property whatsoever, needs to get checked.",1,Electric Butterfly
381,"I have been here for three years. This place has serious problems. To summarize from personal experience:

If someone has a legitimate noise complaint, it will be ignored. I have spoken with management several times and even called the police on these noise terrorists and there is no consequence for them.

Also, doing basic things like making sure the elevators remain clean is a hugely difficult ordeal for management to figure out.
Don't use the elevators on the weekend; if you want to avoid p.t.s.d. from how filthy the trash, cigarette butts and human bodily fluids that build up quickly on the floor of the elevator.

Management tries to be ""nice"", but if there are any complex problems like the ones written above; then either they are extremely slow to respond or do nothing at all and hope that the victim stops complaining and just goes away. And even gaslight you and imply that it must be your fault or are not seeing things clearly!

In terms of quality, just ask for a tour of one of the apartments. Notice, within the unit: there is no garbage disposal system nor a dishwasher; nor a washer and dryer for clothes; there is no central heating and air conditioning; there is no individualized water heater. Also, no gas, only an electric stove. Also, notice the perpetual freeway noise from only a hundred yards away that is audible all day long through closed windows.

Avoid this place, if you want to preserve your sanity. Only move here if you are homeless, extremely disabled, or are so destitute you have no other option. Otherwise, find a better place.

When I move away from here, I will probably be scarred for life!

The pros: Some free food is given away weekly.
A social worker who will listen to you in a neutral, empathetic manner; incapable of helping to resolve any serious issues.
A bus stop, right in front, yay! You get to hear it every day.

For some reason they didnt think the problem thru the parking is terrible they do not have enough parking. There are 90 units and maybe 60 parking spots. The visitor and caretakers take up theparking where the tenant hav no where to park and have to sit in their car until someone leaves. Vistors come and may. Visit a tenant in A or B andC units but park inThe D unit parking leaving no parkig for residence.i once got written upfor going to the managers apartment adkibg for help for i ad no where to park only to be told to park my car on the street a bock away from the apartments thevistors dont cre who lives here and will even park in the reserved parking also. Residence who have lived here for 2 years or more have the problem gotten worse bcos they moved more peple in andthe new tenants takeover the few spots where if you dont get home early you will not have a 0lace to park there are many arguements over this problem residence usensenority to have anyplace to park it will soon get ugly and people will begin to fight.

Such a quaint and quiet place, I've honestly never had any problems throughout my whole year of living here, and I signed my lease for a second year. There were a couple of times when they had to shut off the water or the heater in order to fix an emergency leak, but they always email you as soon as possible, so it's as efficient as can be. Also super convenient because it's close to the bus stops and there's a small marketplace just up the road. If you have the opportunity to live here, I would give it a shot!",5,Kara Sanghera

Ever since Stephanie got hired we have been having so many issues today we all woke up with a notice of Vacate of 60 days but the document says the move out date is august

Stephanie Said we aren’t getting kicked out but we aren’t allowed to reapply next year.
We have been having so many issues to black mold to dirty carpets with move in. The biggest thing is that our upstairs neighbors harass our dog and then complain it will bark.
We have only had the upstairs neighbors complain and Stephanie makes it seem like everyone is complaining. Even though we went to our neighbors to apologize they said they don’t hear our dog.

I do not want to go over all the problems I faced during my stay here, but I will mention this. After my lease ended, I owed them 130 dollars. Instead of reaching out to me, which normally every other apartment complex does. They placed me on collections, and I just a call from collections department. Now this is on my record. This is just totally unacceptable. They placed me on collections 5 days after I left the apartment. They should have contacted me and I would have paid the balance. Disappointed with this behavior from the management.",1,Kuldeep Sharma
385,"This apartment is an utter disaster in every aspect.

**1. Deposit and Extra Charges**
Despite thoroughly cleaning the apartment before moving out, the manager claimed we'd be charged a cleaning fee regardless of how spotless we left the place. This was never stated in the lease agreement, which only required maintaining the apartment at the same level of cleanliness as upon move-in. Infuriatingly, the manager stated, ""NOBODY GETS DEPOSIT BACK"" Those were the manager’s exact words. So, if you're considering renting here, brace yourself for not getting your deposit back.

What really infuriates me is that we left the apartment cleaner than when we moved in (I have video evidence to prove it). Despite two pre-move-out inspections confirming no issues, they still charged us approximately $400 for cleaning and repainting.

Beyond the deposit, there were nonsensical extra expenses, such as being forced to buy renters insurance—a charge I've never encountered in any other rental experience. Plus, the nearly $150 monthly utility fee was a bitter pill to swallow, especially since most places include it in the rent.

Essentially, if you rent this apartment, you’re on the hook for everything from insurance to utilities to refurbishments, responsibilities that should fall to the owner. The landlord seems to shirk all responsibilities except providing the building.

**2. Subpar Cleaning and Renovations**
When we moved in, the cleaning and renovations were subpar. Corners under cabinets, AC intake filter (figure), gaps next to the bathtub, and the top of the refrigerator were all filthy. Even more ridiculous was the big puddle of urine in the toilet left unflushed. And still, they had the audacity to ask us for cleaning fees.

The paint job was sloppy and hastily done, evident from the rough patches where the roller had been.

Moreover, the freshly painted walls emitted a pungent odor that took two weeks of airing out to dissipate, posing a potential health risk.

**3. Appliance Nightmares**
The entire HVAC system was unbelievably loud, especially during startup. The sound of the relay switching on was so intense it was like a gunshot going off in the room. It could wake the dead, and the refrigerator's constant racket could derail anyone trying to work from home. On top of that, all other appliances were also clearly cheap and noisy.

**4. Betrayal of Current Residents**
Before we moved out, the office's renewal offer was $2050 a month, but now new tenants receive an offer of $1875 with six weeks of free rent stated on their website. I can't imagine how disheartening it is for current residents if they find out.

**5. Communication Breakdown**
While the front desk staff was always helpful, they lacked the authority to make decisions. The manager, on the other hand, became completely unresponsive months before our lease ended.

FINAL WARNING: You won’t get what you’ve paid for—high prices in exchange for atrocious service. Not to mention the distance from campus, limited parking, a tiny pool, and a minuscule gym, among other issues.",1,Cody L

392,"The management is careless. I was trying to take a look at the apartment. The first time I went to the office during office hour and he told me there's neither a sample room nor empty room that could be checked out. I was asked for a month. Ok, that was not his fault, but the second time I scheduled a visit with him on a workday, and he told me there's no available room as well. What the huck? I then asked him ""why you told me to come at this time then?"" he said he doesn't remember there's a visit at all. ""You have to wait 1 more month to check out the apartments."" he said. Well, I think his strategy is, ask you to wait until all the other apartments are out, then you have no choice. Good move.",2,Zeyi Wang (uduse)

394,"Bottom line:  I would not do business with First Pointe Management

Speaking in regard to my girlfriend’s unit at Silverstone.  Her unit was rendered uninhabitable by the below tenants who allowed their animals to defecate all over the patio and would not clean it up for months on end.  The smell was unbearable.  We do not know what took place indoors, however, when ever they we’re in town (they were students) she had many problems with roaches, flies, ants, etc. which would magically go away and return with the semester breaks.  Often I saw flies in their windows and once even saw a rat scurry across the sill.

For six months we politely engaged with the managers, providing daily photos and updates at their request.  Eventually the decision was made to enforce the habitability through a “forced termination of lease.”  This was agreed upon with management verbally and a summary put in writing.  He even agreed to the California Move Out Penalty as she was told not to pay the final month’s rent.  (For those readers not in California, when a lease is forcefully terminated by no fault of the tenant, the landlord must provide the equivalent of one months rent for the purpose of relocation).  As I stated to the manager, in California a tenant being terminated under forced conditions such as habitability are under no obligation to provide notice, my discussion with him was merely a courtesy.

One more note about these tenants is that they have a history of tormenting their fellow tenants.  Once they stole a pet from another tenant and the police had to get involved.  Any place I have lived, or any unit I own (yes, I’d say I’m a landlord too, but you’re a slumlord…I’m a landlord, and I find your use of the term to describe yourselves offensive) would have evicted them ASAP, damn the cost because I got a reputation to uphold and services to provide…not just a check to cash.

Also in California, the rent deposit must either be returned, or if not in whole, an itemization of the repairs made must be provided no more than 20 CALENDAR days from the date of move out.  On the 27th day, my girlfriend reached out asking for the status.

Dated and postmarked that same day, these crooks had the nerve to send a $22,000 bill for the rent on the duration of the lease plus damages to the unit.   I call that retaliation and it is that act which took us from a peaceful and mutual parting to this mess.

When speaking with them, the general response was that they do not allow lease termination.  Read between the lines, give them money and they are under no obligation to fulfil their half of the lease agreement or abide by the state tenant protection acts.  She is on the hook until this unit is rented.

I personally find this all laughable, how little they understand the business that they are in.

Regarding the units themselves.  They are old units in poor condition which First Pointe just sticks bandaid after bandaid on.  Going back a few years, she had an air conditioner which kept going out couldn’t cool  Every service person told them they needed to replace it, but they waited for a line to blow and completely flood the unit below (different tenants at the time) and forcing them to stay in a hotel for a week.

They call them upgraded, but all they do is stick some light sensors in, some cheap flooring, and cabinet doors.  You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a filthy pig.

Be warned.  Avoid all costs.  Read the reviews, this and similar stories are all too common.  Do not do business with these crooks.",1,Andrew Gross
394,"I’m going on my 2nd year living at this complex and recently have moved from one of their downstairs units to an upstairs unit. They continue to upgrade and remodel their units and it really shows.

My single favorite part of this complex is the safety. I have never experienced a security issue, even after accidentally leaving the patio door to my ground-floor unit open all night. (one of the perks of living a little further from campus)

Next best part is the beauty. The landscaping really is gorgeous and they maintain it very well. It just makes you happy. I haven’t personally seen rats or roaches or other such creepy things around the complex or in my unit. My downstairs unit was directly facing the street so I assumed I’d have to wrestle a rat or two, but thankfully I never did. Nary a rat nor a roach in sight

The general community that lives here is respectful to one another. I’ve lived in two separate sides of the complex now and haven’t had a noise issue yet.

I felt compelled to write this review because I just received the security deposit refund from my old unit, and it was nearly paid back in full. I’ve never had that happen and was super happy with management.

To top it off, the leasing staff are rockstars. Specifically Dominic and Kendall. They are always warm and personable and have been extremely patient with me on tenant issues.

It did take some time but the problem was solved as soon as they could. We never had any issues with loud noises from neighbors and everyone has been very friendly. The pool area is so relaxing!

394,"RODENTStone (Not SilverStone) - stayed at this place and started having issues when we encountered rats in our apt. Contacted management, their solution was to put traps and get rid of the trapped rats.   Pay over $2k rent and you have to deal with this, when the rats won’t stop coming we hired pest control on our expense and they found a big hole behind the washer area created by rats. We asked management to fix, they sent someone and said it is fixed.
At same time we found out our neighbors were having similar issues.
Few weeks later, it started again and when we looked behind the dryer, the repair was ripped through. Now on contacting management, they replied in email (in writing) that they are aware of rats coming into units due to near by fields and they cannot do much. So have to keep putting traps.
I just saw that there is another review similar to what I am writing.
Won’t recommend this place for the Rodent infestation at this property and for having Paper thin walls…you hear your neighbors shower, flush and all other noises in.
Parking… good luck finding parking close to your unit.. there are cars parked in same spot for six months and not moved at all.",1,Simran G
394,"Look I am going to be professional but I am going to be straightforward. I lived here for 6 months, from January 2018 to June 2018. The complex is very old and they always say that they are remodeling but idk if anything is actually getting done. I shared a two bedroom with a couple and we had roaches, mice, and a reoccuring rat. It's kinda funny too because when I talked to the lady at the front desk she reassured me by saying ""That's only a really common thing on the first floor apartments"".  Wonderful. I feel so secure.

I had to stuff books under my door every night to keep it from coming into my room. On nights that I wasn't home, I would come back and find rat/mouse droppings in my own bed. It literally chewed up my carpet (see photo attached) as well as my clothes and electronics. I had notified the management about this more than once and their only course of action was to set out sticky traps. I had absolutely no food in my room, but it was very interested in my cotton clothes. We had to store all of our food in plastic snapping bins.

I woke up one morning to a bleeding mouse struggling and crying on a sticky trap on my kitchen counter... where I prepare my food!!! We notified management again and specifically asked for no more sticky traps because I couldn't deal with killing the mouse on my own or watching it suffer. I came home from school and they ""surrounded the perimeter"" with more sticky traps. Ugh.

The apartment is in a good location, but there are also people who come at night late from partying and think it's cool to hang outside of your window and chat at 3:30am. That's great, if you like to party but I worked weekends and I really needed my sleep. I actually resorted to staying that night at a friends apartment in Davis instead sometimes, because it was quieter.

A fast forward on the other events I experienced in my short stay was our AC went out, our dishwasher was leaking water every time we used it, I experienced hassle over my monthly payment, the pool and hot tub was closed for most of my stay. Oh- and my bike lock was cut and my bike was stolen there, too!!!

I had an issue with my monthly payment where I accidentally charged my bank for two months rent at once and I wanted to just cancel and redo it (what student can afford that??). The ladies told me that they actually have no control over the site they use to collect rent and that they couldn't do anything to help me. Under the advice of one of them I had to call my bank and cancel the payment formally. I thought after all of that I was in the clear- next week I get a letter of a $50 fee for canceling a check with the apartments.  It would have been nice to know that was going to happen. I can't believe an automated site charges that much for a cancellation. When I went back to question it, the lady at the desk told me she was ""doing me a favor"" because I was supposed to get some other kind of fee too and she ""waived it"" for me. It's hard to believe.

Oh and I almost forgot. I'm pretty sure that Silverstone has an asbestos problem. They say nothing to you when you sign the paper work, but I read the fine print and it's in their disclosure. Make sure you ask if you go in. Now that I think of it, I had a black mold on my ceiling where my AC vent was. Sorry no pics of that.

The only reason I went out of my way to write this review is that it's a little sketch that there is only one google review for this apartment when it's been around for so long- right? I read reviews when I was living there and they followed suit to my experience. I feel like people deserve to know. Everyone has a different experience, sure. I just don't want anyone to make the same mistakes that I did.",1,Kaitlin Clare Kessler

399,"""Don't Fall for Their Tricks! Worst Apartments, Total Scam!""

I lived here, and it was an absolute nightmare. The management treats tenants with disrespect, ignores any requests, and even raises their voice if you demand fairness. There is zero privacy – they collect your personal information, flood you with spam, and possibly sell your data to third parties.

Their financial policies are pure deception. They constantly try to squeeze more money out of you, hidden fees appear out of nowhere, and rent increases happen without explanation. Meanwhile, the apartments are so old and run-down that they aren’t worth even half of what they charge.

And here’s their biggest scam – the so-called ""first month free."" But nobody falls for it, because the price of this outdated complex is higher than renting an entire house! That says it all.

The reputation of this place is completely ruined, and the management is solely to blame. They think they can manipulate people, violate their rights, and collect their personal data without consequences. But sooner or later, they will have to answer to the law.

If you don’t want trouble – stay far away from these apartments!",1,That’s My Dao
399,"It is a nightmare. I have lived here from September last year and started to have very bad allergies. I found that the air condition was 40 years old and looked extremely dirty. The apartment sent in a guy and tried to convince me it was a good machine and when I pointed out the thick dirt on the vents . He told me it was clean. So I took a picture of the vent and sent to Gaby. She said it was because we as tenants were not clean. I was a bit scared with the dirt when I stood on a chair and looked inside. There was a thick layer of dirt there which scared me a bit. Who knows what kind of mold and bacteria in them . So I asked for an air quality check. They told me I should pay myself and it was at least 400 dollars. So I tested using a kit I bought from Amazon. The mold it developed was really scary. No one can use their condition when it was filthy as this. The communication with the apartments was extremely difficult. They used all tactics to delay , avoid problem solving and tried to find fault with you instead.",1,Fengmei li
399,"I’ll start by saying this—I know I’m being a “Karen,” but that’s just how bad this property’s management team has been.

It seems this property used to be a great place to live, but that all changed with the current management, as other reviews confirm.

To be clear, I’m not referring to Miguel, the maintenance man—he’s fantastic and works hard. The issue is the actual management team. They are unprofessional and more focused on minor, petty issues (like small items left on porches) than addressing real, serious concerns.

I ended my lease early due to unsafe living conditions. Rather than taking accountability, management contacted their attorney, who likely advised them to clean up their act. Despite their failures, they refused to waive any part of my lease termination fee, ignoring their responsibilities under California Civil Code §1941.1, which outlines their obligation to maintain habitable conditions.

What’s worse, they are extremely biased toward tenants. We were unlucky enough to live in the unit right next to their office, so we were under constant scrutiny. They nitpicked everything about our unit while being far more lenient with tenants further away. Instead of walking the property consistently to enforce rules fairly, they targeted us disproportionately. To top it off, I’m fairly certain one of their clubhouse cameras was pointed directly at our porch door, which feels like an invasion of privacy and potentially violates California Penal Code §632 regarding recording private activities without consent.

Here are just a few examples of their gross mismanagement:

1. Dangerous Neglect of Repairs: They failed to fix a broken, hazardous railing for months. They were fully aware of the issue, as they wrapped the railing in caution tape multiple times. Despite acknowledging the danger, they never actually fixed it, leaving tenants at risk.
2. Unsafe Night Conditions: Broken lights and inadequate lighting left large areas dark and unsafe, leading to theft and making it dangerous to walk around at night.
3. Unreasonable Pet Policies: While the complex allows pets (which is great), the management team complained about barking, claiming it was distracting to their work. No residents ever reported issues with barking—it was solely a problem for management, which is completely unreasonable.
4. Unsanitary Conditions: Turkey poop is everywhere, creating health risks and making the property unpleasant to live in. They seem completely incapable or unwilling to address this issue.
Cockroach Infestation: If you venture out at night, be prepared to encounter—and kill—countless cockroaches. This issue alone makes the property unsanitary and unlivable.
5. Aggressive Lease Renewals: Management pressures tenants to renew leases early, claiming rates will increase. However, they’re already among the most expensive options in the area.
The good news? Davis has plenty of other, better housing options with competent management teams and safer, cleaner environments. This property is simply not worth the stress.

401,"Spoke with Andrew when touring the apartment seemed nice only because after that he asked me to write a review. I wonder why? Maybe just check out some of the other reviews and see for yourself. Just called 6 months later spoke with Andrew again and it was a total 360 change for his attitude. You cant be snippy answering questions about someones lease when you work in a leasing office. You asked for a review Andrew so yes he was nice when he wanted something from me and when he did not, was not so nice.",1,Brooke Spellerberg
401,"Sol is a beautiful option for student housing at UC Davis. The amenities outweigh many other places in town. I love the parklike atmosphere. Brooke was very helpful showing us around and pointing out features like the covered bbq areas, pools, spas, sand volleyball courts and the dog park!",5,Heather McNaughton
401,"Andrew was our tour guide, and LET ME TELL YOU, he was amazing. Andrew put up with our unfunny jokes (even laughing with us,) showed us every single detail of the apartment we toured, and made sure we left completely satisfied and with no lingering questions! Andrew is THE goat. If you’re going to tour, ask for my man Andrew. Sol is beautiful too (but Andrew is the man!)",5,Liv James

410,"Living here with fellow transfer students was awesome! This place sets a high bar for other types of housing on the market but thankfully it is an SHA community.

First off, I was surprised by how much closet & room space I had, the wood floors, and a patio. My roomie and I lived comfortably in a 2bd1br. The AC gets real frosty which I appreciate during the hot Davis summers. Staff were on-site during pretty much all business hours and all very nice people. You can tell they put a lot of work into maintaining this place. Oh and it’s right on campus, which means all your classes are within a 5 minute bike ride away as well as downtown Davis. If you can get a unit here then I would highly recommend you go for it.",5,Jane Q. Public

412,"This is one of the worst places I’ve rented in Davis. They take advantage of the student population by overcharging on rent and fees while neglecting the complex.

The rent for a 2 bedroom is significantly higher compared to what else you can get in the area. No dishwasher, no microwave, broken sliding doors and locks, poor tiling in bathroom. Water is never at a decent temperature. Either boiling or freezing cold. Even the lower floor patio is a sham. Rain water goes right through the boards leaving everything soaked and moldy, so don’t get excited about having furniture out there (great for plants, I guess).

She’s leaving soon, but the previous property manager we had was very condescending and rude. She wouldn’t put up any notices, would ignore maintenance requests or say she forgot to put them in. She made the experience of living there significantly worse. Literally laughed in our faces when our toilet became uninhabitable because “toilet water on the floor isn’t an emergency”. The maintenance guy was nice, but there’s only one for the entire complex.

One of the few places where you don’t even get one free parking space, you either have to pay $25-$35/mo. for a space of use street parking. The previous property manager lied saying there’s plenty of parking, but there’s not.

They charge a fee for a laundry card and had issues with their card reader not working. It’s been over 4 months since the issue was first brought up and nothing has changed. It took months for us to even have them put up signs to tell tenants that they don’t work before they put their clothes in.

The bike lock area is useless. Can barely lock your front wheel.

The only bonus to this place is that it’s close to campus and there’s a jacuzzi. Absolutely not worth it, regret signing the lease everyday I stay here. avoid at all cost.",1,Syrene B.
412,"Ran down apartments, just a real slumlord who is obviously taking advantage of parents and students who are new to area and cannot view before moving in. Pool is not usable! I feel bad for the property manager because she has to deliver the awful news. Rugs are flithy and semi cleaned (not properly) after previous tenants vacate, mini blinds broken and glued back together, large pieces of laminate are chipped off and instead of covering drawers, maintenance just painted over missing laminate, hinges on the verge of falling off, and there has to be fungus in the walls! Beware! Know that you are really paying for location ONLY.",1,Julie Strider
412,"Avoid. Not only was the experience here terrible-- construction constantly the entire year with no prior warning. Without windows for days in the middle of winter, no insulation either. Heater didn't work, wasn't given a smoke alarm for months, moved in and it was disgusting (spider webs everywhere, mold in the bathroom, dirt on the walls, etc.). Came back after visiting family (gone for weeks) to my door wide open due to the construction I was not informed would be happening. Had my bike lock cut and bike taken without being informed and it wasn't until I reached out they told me they were moving bikes for construction. Loud banging on the walls at all hours. Calls and emails ignored, and no help in any of the matters. Now, after the lease finally finished and I moved out, it's been nearly 2 months since we've heard anything about the security deposit, and still haven't got anything back. Do not rent here.",1,Jordan Blair
412,"I usually don't write reviews or anything but I just had to for this place. I have been staying here for about 5 months and I cannot wait to get out. Heres the story that just did it for me. I went home for the weekend and the management decided to install AC inside my room without notice. The worse part was, they decided to sand down their BAD installation and got dust literally EVERYWHERE. There is a thick layer of dust on all my stuff. They did not bother to cover ANY of my furnitures and just left it as is. Whatever you do, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. They need to seriously replace their management. They have no respect for others properties.",2,Triet Nguyen

414,"I really enjoyed living here while finishing my degree. They kept the property looking nice at all times and the staff were friendly. I loved using the grill area and was amazed how well they kept it maintained. Maintenance was always quick to respond to our needs and also friendly. I loved that they had treats during the holidays and for finals as well. It was nice because we all know finals are stressful and they cared about the students by having treats and at times, a food truck. I loved the location. Getting around Davis was easy with the convenient location. Overall, had a pleasant experience.",4,Anthony Bustamante
414,"Pros about living here.
It’s pretty, well maintained landscaping, pool is for the most part always clean.
Cons
The bathroom doesn’t have any ventilation and grows mold very easily and is probably all throughout the apartment because they don’t deal with it from previous tenants. Denied ESA initially because we had to have separate conditions for each animal and disclose it to management.
Studio and single bedroom ac units don’t keep the place cool.
1 bedroom ac isn’t in the bedroom
Told us they needed to come into the unit for a “plumbing leak” but then proceeded to take pictures of everything and inspect for damages.
Train is annoying and goes on all day. Doesn’t happen to much at night but every day it gets annoying.
Pool isn’t 24/7 it closes early in the night.
Parking is a nightmare.
Overall wouldn’t recommend since there are better options for close to the same price",1,J

414,"I lived at this apartment with my college roommates for the duration of last year. Around January, when the wet season came around, we all discovered mold covering our bedroom walls behind our beds and furniture. When we brought it to the attention of management, they were extremely unclear and slow in decision-making, and threatened to make us pay for remediation. The situation became very tense, and they told us we’d have to throw out all of our furniture if we wanted to stay in the apartment. They finally gave us the option of exiting our lease and we took them up on it. We were under the impression they were going to rip up the floors and walls to find the source of the mold and remediate it, but only 2 weeks later we saw the apartment up on the market again. Overall, they created a very stressful environment, especially for college students who’s lives are stressful enough. Between having to get lawyers involved and finding emergency housing, it felt like they were taking advantage of us. I would not advise leasing here.",1,Emma Roginski
414,"My daughter and roommates lived here for a couple of years. They complained about mold on several occasions. First they were told they were not cleaning the bathroom ceiling well enough. Then maintenance just painted over the mold.
My daughter had to leave Davis due to severe medical issues before this latest lease was up. We were not able to get her out of her lease unless she found another roommate to take her place. We continued playing until this month.
We went to move the rest if her belongings out and the while plane smells musty from mold. After moving her bed, we found mold  under her
Bed  and on the baseboards as well. UNACCEPTABLE. We are now having to throw away everything that cannot be cleaned, including a new mattress.
For a place that charges roughly $2800 with utilities charged, this is disgusting. Below is what mold can do to a person. My daughter had every single symptom.
Mold toxicity can manifest in different ways in people. It's more commonly linked to physical problems, such as difficulty breathing, fatigue, and headaches, but research shows that it can present itself in a psychiatric way, too. This includes brain fog, depression, anxiety, problems concentrating, and insomnia.

We will be pursuing this further. Did anyone else experience mold problems?

Also, the management told the young girls to keep their bathroom window open to help with the mold, which they did. One night a roommate was in the bathroom and there was a man peering through the window. He had stolen a chair off the porch to use to peek in. Management was alerted. Not only did they not contact the girls back, they never alerted the  other tenants if a peeping Tom. Parents our young kids live here. The police came, but never found the guy, only the chair that he used to look into their bathroom.  This place is NOT SAFE!!!!",1,Jennie Peterson

It is really close to the bus stops and a supermarket and many other food places (all which were very crucial for me as a college student). So I never had to worry traveling far for food!

Their manager, Chaprix, is truly a wonderful, funny, and super helpful person! Whenever I had a problem, she would try her best to immediately rectify it. She is super supportive that she would have a small brunch for students (but everyone was definitely encouraged to come) during their final weeks! She is was the first apartment manager I ever had since I moved to Davis to go to college and I have to say that she has definitely set up my expectations on what it means to be a great manager!",5,ashillo9 “ashillo9”

427,"This place is “cheap” for a reason. Quality of the housing itself is terrible. Management is even worse especially with CRYSTAL running things. Rent goes up every month too and management will always find ways to pinch you for more money. Management is also terrible when it comes to getting tenants on leases in a timely manner, as well as CRYSTAL being one of the most rude, manipulative managers to be there. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for housing unless you want to be frustrated 24/7.",1,TheDarkKnight21120
427,"My unit itself honestly wasn't the best, but for the price I paid it was the best deal ever. I've never had any issues with maintenance or management. The other reviews called out Crystal but I think she's extremely kind, caring, and responsive. I do agree with the other reviews about there being mold in the bathroom. The ventilation is lacking but I just used mold killer whenever mold grew. Now that I moved out I can say with confidence that I miss this place and I would move back if I ever have a reason to move back to Davis",5,Darian A.
427,"I believe my review was removed but I think it is important that people are aware of my experience if considering signing a lease here. In my personal experience: I completely regret my decision to live here. CRYSTAL JAMES, the landlady for the complex, while seeming nice on the surface, is one of the most manipulative and rude people I have ever interacted with. If you come to her with any issue, you will only have your ear talked off with a ridiculous amount of excuses and *embellishments* of the truth. She will talk behind your back badly to other tenants if you try to make her do her job in a timely manner. There is chronic BLACK mold in the bathrooms that she also refused to deal with and loves to add petty little charges to you wherever she can. PLEASE do yourself a favor and find literally anywhere else to spend your time in money where you will be respected and not overcharged.",1,Carly Marshall

431,"ZERO STARS is my true rating for Dowling Properties. Just like most property management companies in Davis, Dowling is run by a bunch of con artists and cheapskates. Where do I begin?

They tried to charge us $25/month on their online portal than our lease stated. When we pointed it out, they took no accountability.

They have contracts with “vendors” aka their friends’ and families’ companies to do unnecessary yard work and construction every week. Love those 7am lawn mowers right outside my window!

They refuse to make even the bare minimum repairs to keep our house safe and structurally sound. The house is 60 years old, and it shows.

I have bonked my head so hard on the old AC unit they left in the window that I had to go to the ER. I have slashed my arm open several times on wood board with nails that are hanging off of the totally janky fence.

If you ask for any repairs, expect an attitude. They treat you like you’re an inconvenience to them rather than their source of income. Complete scum bags!",1,Harley Minx
431,"I have rented an apartment from Dowling for the last two years and recently moved out. They were friendly, helpful, and their repair person always responded to things quickly. I'm not usually one to have positive feelings towards landlords/property management companies, but this one seemed to earnestly aim to treat us well.  An example - The washer or dryer broke 2-3 times while we lived there (as expected. Those machines served 4 units with lots of students in each.), and each time they were fixed or replaced quickly, often the day after we notified them. We will be getting our deposit back soon, and my interactions with them so far have led me to believe they won't be taking advantage of us in what we get back. The primary people with have interacted with at Dowling are Eric Ferch for most communication and Kelly for maintenance.",5,Brad Sparks
431,I'm a renter in a house through Dowling currently and so far have had only positive experiences with them. They are always really quick with responding to us through phone and email. They always are very helpful with maintenance issues as well. Everyone I've interacted with at the office in person or over the phone has been very personable and helpful. Would definitely recommend them as one of the better property managements in Davis.,5,Summer Camporesi
431,"I was disappointed in my experience as a renter with Dowling Properties. Renting directly from the property owner was great. However, once Dowling Properties entered the picture, it all went to hell.

The cost of rent went up dramatically in order to pay Dowling Properties' fees, yet I received no benefit from them whatsoever. All of their correspondence with me was unprofessional and lacking attention to detail. They told me my rent was overdue when in fact it had already been paid on time and sent me an email intended for my next door neighbor. The email chain included the email addresses of all the tenants with late payments.

After I had the unit thoroughly cleaned, they charged me extensively for cleaning fees and carpet shampooing after I moved out. Note that the carpets were stained and smelled of urine when I originally moved in and the place was not clean at that time. I brought it up to a cleaner standard than it was initially. They took nearly all of my deposit. After I've lived there for multiple years with normal wear and tear, they charged me for painting and other basic expenses. I maintained the property, always paid my rent on time and they tried to nickel and dime me for things that should be paid for by the property owner. I cannot believe they won't replace the carpets when they were old and dirty when I originally moved in.",1,Andrew Romero
